Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Citi prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also 
presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP 
measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include 
components that differ from the most directly comparable 
measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-
GAAP measures are provided as additional useful information 
to assess Citi’s financial condition and results of operations, 
including providing an additional meaningful depiction of 
underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results. 
These non-GAAP measures are not intended as a substitute for 
GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or 
calculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar 
names used by other companies. 

Citi’s non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q 

include:

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Second Quarter of 2023—Results Continued to Benefit 
from Diversified Business Model and Strong Balance Sheet
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, 
during the second quarter of 2023:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s revenues decreased 1% versus the prior-year period, 
both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related 
impacts (see “Legacy Franchises” below). The decrease 
in revenues was primarily driven by lower non-interest 
revenues, mainly offset by higher net interest income. 
Citi’s expenses increased 9% versus the prior-year period, 
both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture-related 
impacts (see “Legacy Franchises” below), largely driven 
by continued investments in risk and controls, business-
led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth and 
macroeconomic factors, including inflation, as well as 
severance costs. The expense increase was partially offset 
by productivity savings and an expense reduction from 
the exited markets and continued wind-downs (see 
“Expenses” below).
Citi’s cost of credit was $1.8 billion versus $1.3 billion in 
the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven 
by higher net credit losses, reflecting the continued 
normalization in net credit losses in Branded cards and 
Retail services.
Citi returned $2.0 billion to common shareholders in the 
form of dividends and share repurchases. As previously 
disclosed, in July 2023 Citi’s Board of Directors declared 
a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.53 per share for 
the third quarter of 2023, up from $0.51 in the previous 
quarter. Citi intends to maintain a quarterly common 
dividend of at least $0.53 per share, subject to financial 
and macroeconomic conditions, as well as Board of 
Directors approval. 
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under 
the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 13.4% 
as of June 30, 2023, compared to 12.0% as of June 30, 
2022 (see “Capital Resources” below). This compares to 
Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.0% as 
of January 1, 2023 under the Basel III Standardized 
Approach. As previously disclosed, on October 1, 2023, 
Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio will increase 
to 12.3% from 12.0% under the Standardized Approach 
reflecting the increase in the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) 
requirement to 4.3% from 4.0% (see “Capital Resources
—Stress Capital Buffer” below).
In May 2023, Citi announced that it intends to pursue an 
initial public offering (IPO) of its consumer, small 
business and middle-market banking operations in 
Mexico, following the planned separation from Citi’s 
Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and Private bank 
businesses in Mexico, both of which will remain part of 
Citi. 

• Citi continued to make progress on its other consumer 
banking business divestitures in the second quarter of 
2023, including working toward the closing of its Taiwan 
and Indonesia sale transactions in the second half of 2023, 
as well as progressing with the continued wind-downs of 
the Korea and China consumer banking businesses and the 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional 
businesses. In addition, Citi intends to restart the exit 
process for the consumer banking business in Poland later 
in 2023, subject to market conditions.

Second Quarter of 2023 Results Summary

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $2.9 billion, or $1.33 per 
share, compared to net income of $4.5 billion, or $2.19 per 
share in the prior-year period. The decrease in net income was 
primarily driven by the higher expenses and the higher cost of 
credit, as well as the lower revenues. Citigroup’s effective tax 
rate was approximately 27% in the current quarter versus 20% 
in the prior-year period, largely driven by the geographic mix 
of earnings (see “Income Taxes” below). Earnings per share 
(EPS) decreased 39% from the prior-year period, reflecting the 
lower net income and an approximate 1% increase in average 
diluted shares outstanding. 

Results for the second quarter of 2023 included 

divestiture-related impacts of $(73) million in earnings before 
taxes ($(92) million after-tax). See “Legacy Franchises” and 
“Corporate/Other” below for details about the divestiture-
related impacts. 

These divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a 

$(0.04) negative impact on EPS in the current quarter. 
Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $1.37. 
(As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s results of 
operations and financial condition excluding the impact of 
divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial measures.)

Results for the second quarter of 2022 included 

divestiture-related impacts of $48 million in earnings before 
taxes ($35 million after-tax). See “Legacy Franchises” below 
for details about the divestiture-related impacts. 

These divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a 
$0.02 beneficial impact on EPS in the prior-year period. 
Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $2.17.

Citigroup revenues of $19.4 billion in the second quarter 

of 2023 decreased 1% from the prior-year period, both on a 
reported basis and excluding divestiture-related impacts. The 
lower revenues reflected a decline in revenues across Markets 
and Investment banking in ICG and Global Wealth 
Management (Global Wealth) in Personal Banking and 
Wealth Management (PBWM), as well as a revenue reduction 
from the exited markets and continued wind-downs in Legacy 
Franchises. The decline in revenues was largely offset by 
strength across Services in ICG, U.S. Personal Banking 
revenues in PBWM and higher revenues from the investment 
portfolio in Corporate/Other.

     3                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $661 billion, up 1% 

versus the prior-year period, driven by growth in PBWM, 
primarily driven by U.S. Personal Banking, largely offset by 
declines in ICG and Legacy Franchises. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately 
$1.3 trillion, largely unchanged versus the prior-year period, 
as a decrease in ICG, primarily driven by Securities services, 
was offset by an increase in institutional certificates of deposit 
in Corporate/Other. For additional information about Citi’s 
deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see 
each respective business’s results of operations and “Liquidity 
Risk—Deposits” below.

Expenses
Citigroup’s operating expenses of $13.6 billion increased 9% 
from the prior-year period, both on a reported basis and 
excluding divestiture-related impacts. The higher expenses 
largely reflected continued investments in risk and controls, 
business-led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth 
and macroeconomic factors, including inflation, as well as 
severance costs. The higher expenses were partially offset by 
productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited 
markets and wind-downs in Legacy Franchises.

As previously disclosed, Citi expects a sequential increase 

in expenses for the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting 
continued investments in Citi’s transformation and other risk 
and controls. 

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims was a cost of $1.8 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in 
the prior-year period. This increase was driven by higher net 
credit losses (see below), partially offset by a lower net build 
of $320 million in the ACL for loans and unfunded 
commitments and other provisions. The net ACL build and 
other provisions in the current quarter were primarily driven 
by growth in card balances in Branded cards and Retail 
services. This compared to a net ACL build and other 
provisions of $424 million in the prior-year period. For 
additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant 
Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Citi’s 
Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below. 

Net credit losses of $1.5 billion increased 77% from the 
prior year. Consumer net credit losses of $1.4 billion increased 
73%, reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly in 
Branded cards and Retail services. Corporate net credit losses 
increased to $75 million from $23 million.

Citi also expects to incur higher year-over-year net credit 

losses for the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by 
continued normalization, particularly in the cards business in 
PBWM.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs, see each respective business’s results of 
operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.4% as of June 30, 
2023, compared to 12.0% as of June 30, 2022, based on the 
Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-
weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by 

net income, the impacts from the closing of the Asia consumer 
banking business sales and business actions, including a 
reduction in RWA, partially offset by the payment of common 
dividends and share repurchases. 

As previously announced, during the second quarter of 

2023, Citi resumed common share repurchases, and 
repurchased $1.0 billion of common shares (see “Unregistered 
Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities 
and Dividends” below). Citi will continue to assess common 
share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given 
uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For 
additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory 
Capital Standards and Developments” below.

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of June 30, 
2023 was 6.0%, compared to 5.7% as of June 30, 2022. The 
increase was driven by higher Tier 1 Capital, partially offset 
by an increase in Total Leverage Exposure. For additional 
information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, 
see “Capital Resources” below.

Institutional Clients Group
ICG net income of $2.2 billion decreased 45%, primarily 
driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of 
credit. ICG operating expenses of $7.3 billion increased 13%, 
primarily driven by continued investments in Treasury and 
trade solutions (TTS), continued risk and controls investments 
and severance costs in Markets and Investment banking, 
partially offset by productivity savings.

ICG revenues of $10.4 billion decreased 9% (including 
gain (loss) on loan hedges), primarily driven by a decline in 
Markets and Banking, partially offset by growth in Services. 
Results included a loss on loan hedges of $66 million in the 
second quarter of 2023, compared with a gain on loan hedges 
of $494 million in the prior-year period.

Services revenues of $4.7 billion increased 15%. TTS 
revenues of $3.5 billion increased 15%, driven by 18% growth 
in net interest income and 8% growth in non-interest revenue. 
Strong performance in TTS was primarily driven by higher 
interest rates and non-interest revenue benefits from continued 
growth of underlying drivers, primarily an 11% increase in 
cross-border transaction value and a 15% increase in 
commercial card spend volume. Securities services revenues 
of $1.1 billion increased 15%, as net interest income increased 
62%, largely driven by higher interest rates across currencies.
Markets revenues of $4.6 billion decreased 13%, driven 
by lower revenues in both Fixed income markets and Equity 
markets relative to strong performance in the prior-year 
period, as well as low volatility in the second quarter of 2023. 
Fixed income markets revenues of $3.5 billion decreased 13%, 
driven by declines in currencies and commodities, partially 
offset by modest growth in rates. Equity markets revenues of 
$1.1 billion decreased 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in 
equity derivatives revenues.

Banking revenues of $1.2 billion decreased 44%, 

including the gain (loss) on loan hedges in the current quarter 
and the prior-year period. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan 
hedges, Banking revenues of $1.2 billion decreased 22%, 
driven by lower revenues in Investment banking and 
Corporate lending. Investment banking revenues of $612 
million decreased 24%, reflecting a decline in the overall 

     4                                                                                                                                                                                                            

market wallet, as continued macroeconomic and geopolitical 
uncertainty continued to adversely impact client activity. 
Corporate lending revenues decreased 56%, including the 
impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact 
of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate lending revenues 
decreased 20% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven 
by the impacts of foreign currency translation and lower 
lending volumes. (As used throughout this Form 10-Q, Citi’s 
results of operations and financial condition excluding the 
impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP 
financial measures.) 

For additional information on the results of operations of 
ICG for the second quarter of 2023, see “Institutional Clients 
Group” below.

Personal Banking and Wealth Management
PBWM net income of $494 million decreased 11%, driven by 
higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by 
higher revenues. PBWM operating expenses of $4.2 billion 
increased 5%, primarily driven by continued risk and controls 
investments.

PBWM revenues of $6.4 billion increased 6%, as net 
interest income growth, driven by strong loan growth across 
U.S. Personal Banking, was partially offset by a decline in 
non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment product 
revenues in Global Wealth.

U.S. Personal Banking revenues of $4.6 billion increased 

11%, primarily driven by higher revenues in cards, partially 
offset by lower Retail banking revenues. Branded cards 
revenues of $2.4 billion increased 8%, primarily driven by the 
higher net interest income, as average loans increased 14%. 
Retail services revenues of $1.6 billion increased 27%, 
primarily driven by the higher net interest income, as well as 
lower partner payments. Retail banking revenues of $594 
million decreased 9%, primarily reflecting the transfer of 
certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to 
Global Wealth.

Global Wealth revenues of $1.8 billion decreased 5%, 

largely driven by continued investment product revenue 
headwinds and higher interest rates paid on deposits, partially 
offset by the benefits from the continued transfer of Retail 
banking relationships.

For additional information on the results of operations of 
PBWM for the second quarter of 2023, see “Personal Banking 
and Wealth Management” below.

Legacy Franchises
Legacy Franchises recorded a net loss of $125 million, 
compared to a net loss of $17 million in the prior-year period, 
primarily driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by 
lower expenses. Legacy Franchises expenses of $1.8 billion 
decreased 2%, primarily driven by the impact of exited 
markets and continued wind-downs.

Legacy Franchises revenues of $1.9 billion decreased 1%, 

driven by the reductions from exited markets and continued 
wind-downs, partially offset by the benefit of higher rates and 
lending volumes in Mexico Consumer/SBMM, as well as 
higher revenues in Legacy Holdings Assets. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Legacy Franchises for the second quarter of 2023, see 
“Legacy Franchises” below.

Corporate/Other 
Corporate/Other net income was $356 million, compared to 
$50 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher 
net interest income from Deposits with banks and the 
investment portfolio, a reserve release related to the repayment 
of the previously disclosed First Republic Bank deposit and 
the prior-year release of a CTA loss (net of hedges) from 
AOCI (for additional information, see Note 2). The increase in 
net income was partially offset by lower income tax benefits 
and higher expenses. Corporate/Other operating expenses of 
$302 million increased from $160 million in the prior-year 
period, primarily driven by the impact of inflation and 
severance costs and the absence of certain settlements that 
occurred in the prior-year period, partially offset by lower 
consulting expenses.

Corporate/Other revenues of $677 million increased from 

$255 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by 
higher net interest income from Deposits with banks and the 
investment portfolio, largely due to higher interest rates. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Corporate/Other for the second quarter of 2023, see 
“Corporate/Other” below.

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory 
challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely impact 
economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including 
central banks continuing to increase interest rates, continued 
elevated levels of inflation and economic and geopolitical 
challenges related to both China and the Russia–Ukraine war. 
These and other factors have adversely affected financial 
markets, negatively impacted global economic growth rates 
and raised fears of recession in the U.S., Europe and other 
regions and countries. In addition, these and other factors 
could adversely affect Citi’s customers, clients, businesses, 
funding costs, expenses and overall results of operations and 
financial condition during the remainder of 2023.

In May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

(FDIC) issued a proposal that would implement a special 
assessment to recover its uninsured deposit losses from recent 
bank failures. The FDIC estimated that the preliminary cost of 
the failures is approximately $15.8 billion, an estimate that 
would be periodically adjusted. If finalized as proposed, the 
FDIC is proposing to collect the special assessment at an 
annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points of uninsured 
deposits, over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning in 
2024. Citi is likely to incur a significant increase in its 
operating expenses if the final rule for the FDIC special 
assessment is enacted as proposed, which is expected before 
the end of 2023. For additional information on the expected 
impact, see Note 26. 

In July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of 
proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame, related 
to regulatory capital requirements. The rule as proposed would 
have a material impact on Citi’s current capital position; 
however, its finalization and implementation will be a

multiyear process, including phase-in periods to meet the new 
capital requirements. Citi plans to comment on the proposal 
and adapt business activities to address associated impacts, if 
necessary, and will be in compliance with the final rule, once 
it is in effect and implemented. For additional information, see 
“Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards and 
Developments” below.

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks 

that will or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations, capital and other financial condition during the 
remainder of 2023, see “Second Quarter of 2023 Results 
Summary” above and each respective business’s results of

(1)  Certain series of preferred stock have semiannual payment dates. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 
(2)  The return on average common stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income less preferred stock dividends divided by average common stockholders’ 

equity. The return on average total Citigroup stockholders’ equity is calculated using net income divided by average Citigroup stockholders’ equity.

(3)  RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. For information on RoTCE and TBVPS, see “Capital Resources—Tangible Common Equity, Book Value 

Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity” below.

(4)  Citi’s binding CET1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas Citi’s binding Total Capital ratio was 

derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for both periods presented.

(5)  Certain of the above prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with enhancements made in the current period.
(6)  Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net income per diluted share.
(7)  Total common dividends declared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders (Net income less preferred 

dividends). See “Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity,” Note 9 and “Equity Security Repurchases” below for the component details.

(1) The supplemental information presented in the table above reflects Citigroup’s consolidated GAAP balance sheet by reportable segment and component. The 

respective segment information depicts the assets and liabilities managed by each segment.

(2) Consolidating eliminations for total Citigroup and Citigroup parent company assets and liabilities are recorded within Corporate/Other.
(3) The total equity and the majority of long-term debt of Citigroup are reflected on the Citigroup parent company balance sheet (see Notes 17 and 27). Citigroup 

allocates stockholders’ equity and long-term debt to its businesses through intersegment allocations as shown above.

(4) Represents the attribution of Citigroup’s liquid assets (primarily consisting of cash, marketable equity securities and AFS debt securities) to the various businesses 

based on Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR) assumptions.
(5) Corporate/Other equity represents noncontrolling interests.

INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP

Institutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Services, Markets and Banking (for additional information on these businesses, see 
“Citigroup Operating Segments” above). ICG provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full 
range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime 
brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, cash 
management, trade finance and securities services. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed 
income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products. For more information on ICG’s business activities, see “Institutional 
Clients Group” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 

ICG’s international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 

countries and jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, as of March 31, 2023, Citi ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it 
offered in Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. For 
additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see “Legacy Franchises” and 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below.

At June 30, 2023, ICG had $1.8 trillion in assets and $818 billion in deposits. Securities services managed $23.7 trillion in assets 
under custody and administration at June 30, 2023, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients 
related to $2.2 trillion of such assets. Managed assets under trust were $4.1 trillion at June 30, 2023. For additional information on 
these operations, see “Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees” in Note 5.

(1)  Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate Net 

interest income may be risk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal transactions revenue within Non-interest revenue. For a description of the 
composition of these revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6.

(2)  Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on 

loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed premium

costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the 
impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

NM Not meaningful

The discussion of the results of operations for ICG below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual 
loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.

2Q23 vs. 2Q22
Net income of $2.2 billion decreased 45%, primarily driven by 
lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit.
Revenues decreased 9% (including gain (loss) on loan 

hedges), driven by lower Banking and Markets revenues, 
partially offset by higher Services revenues. Banking revenues 
were down 44% (including the impact of the gain (loss) on 
loan hedges), reflecting lower revenues in both Investment 
banking and Corporate lending. Markets revenues were down 
13%, driven by lower revenues in both Fixed income markets 
and Equity markets, due to lower client activity, driven by 
decreased volatility and a strong prior-year comparison. 
Services revenues were up 15%, driven by higher revenues in 
both TTS and Securities services.

Citi expects that revenues in its Markets and Investment 
banking businesses will continue to reflect the overall market 
environment during the remainder of 2023.

Within Services:

•

•

TTS revenues increased 15%, driven by 18% growth in 
net interest income and 8% growth in non-interest 
revenue, reflecting strong growth across all client 
segments. The increase in net interest income was 
primarily driven by higher interest rates as well as growth 
in deposits, partially offset by higher interest rates paid on 
deposits. Average deposits increased 2%, largely driven 
by growth in EMEA and Latin America. Average loans 
decreased 6%, reflecting business actions taken to reduce 
RWA. The increase in non-interest revenue was primarily 
driven by strong fee growth in the cash business, 
reflecting solid client engagement and continued growth 
of underlying drivers, reflecting higher cross-border flows 
(up 11%) and commercial card spend (up 15%).
Securities services revenues increased 15%, as net interest 
income grew 63%, driven by higher interest rates across 
currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset 
by the impact of an 8% decline in average deposits. Non-
interest revenues decreased 5%, primarily driven by 
custody fee spread compression, partially offset by higher 
assets under custody and administration and continued 
elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer services.

Within Markets:

•

Fixed income markets revenues decreased 13%, driven by 
North America, EMEA and Asia, largely due to decreased 
institutional and corporate client activity.

Rates and currencies decreased 12%, largely due to a 

decline in the currencies business, driven by EMEA, 
primarily reflecting lower volatility and a strong prior-
year comparison, partially offset by a modest increase in 
the rates business. Spread products and other fixed 
income revenues decreased 17%, due to a decline across 

•

regions in commodities, driven by lower corporate and 
institutional client activity, as well as a decline in the 
financing and securitization business, as the business 
further reduced its subscription credit facilities portfolio. 
Equity markets revenues decreased 10%, driven by North 
America and Asia. The decline primarily reflected lower 
equity derivatives revenues, driven by a more challenging 
macroeconomic environment, lower volatility and a 
strong prior-year comparison. The decline in equity 
derivatives revenues was partially offset by an increase in 
equity cash, reflecting a modest increase in institutional 
client activity. Prime finance revenues were largely 
unchanged, while prime finance balances continued to 
grow in the quarter. 

Within Banking:

•

•

Investment banking revenues declined 24%, reflecting a 
decline in the overall market wallet, as ongoing 
macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty continued to 
adversely impact client activity. Advisory revenues 
decreased 55%, reflecting a decline in North America and 
Asia, partially offset by growth in EMEA. The decrease in 
advisory revenues was driven by the lower market wallet 
as well as lower wallet share. Equity underwriting 
revenues decreased 8%, reflecting a decline in North 
America, Asia and EMEA, driven by lower wallet share, 
partially offset by growth in the market wallet. Debt 
underwriting revenues increased 6%, reflecting growth in 
North America and EMEA, driven by wallet share gains, 
largely in the investment-grade portfolio, partially offset 
by the decline in the market wallet.
Corporate lending revenues decreased 56%, including the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues 
decreased 20%, primarily driven by the impacts of foreign 
currency translation and lower lending volumes. 

Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued 

investment in TTS, risk and controls investments and 
severance costs in Markets and Investment banking, partially 
offset by productivity savings. 

Provisions reflected a cost of $58 million, compared to a 
benefit of $202 million in the prior-year period, largely driven 
by an ACL build for other assets and higher net credit losses. 
Net credit losses were $73 million, compared to $18 million in 
the prior-year period.

The ACL release was $15 million, compared to a release 
of $220 million in the prior-year period. The $15 million ACL 
release was driven by a net ACL release for loans and 
unfunded lending commitments of $238 million, primarily due 
to an improved macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a 
$223 million build for other assets, primarily related to an 
increase in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the 

     14                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Within Banking:

•

•

Investment banking revenues decreased 24%. Advisory 
revenues decreased 36% and equity underwriting 
revenues decreased 25%, driven by the same factors 
described above. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 
13%, largely driven by the lower market wallet.
Corporate lending revenues decreased 56%, including the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges. Excluding the 
impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues 
decreased 17%, driven by the same factors described 
above.

Expenses increased 8%, primarily driven by continued 
investment in Citi’s transformation, investments in TTS, other 
risk and controls investments, volume-related expenses and 
other structural expenses, including severance costs, partially 
offset by productivity savings and foreign exchange 
translation.

Provisions reflected a benefit of $14 million, compared to 

a cost of $769 million in the prior-year period, largely driven 
by a net ACL release for loans and unfunded lending 
commitments, compared to an ACL build in the prior-year 
period. Net credit losses were $95 million, compared to $48 
million in the prior-year period. 

The ACL release was $109 million, compared to a build 
of $721 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL 
release for loans and unfunded lending commitments of $483 
million, due to an improved macroeconomic outlook and 
Russia loan reductions, partially offset by a $374 million build 
for other assets, primarily related to an increase in transfer risk 
associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety 
and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

2Q23 YTD vs. 2Q22 YTD
Net income of $5.4 billion decreased 17%, primarily driven by 
lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by lower 
cost of credit.

Revenues decreased 4% (including gain (loss) on loan 

hedges), driven by lower Banking and Markets revenues, 
partially offset by higher Services revenues. Banking revenues 
were down 41% (including the impact of the gain (loss) on 
loan hedges), reflecting lower revenues in both Investment 
banking and Corporate lending. Markets revenues were down 
8%, driven by lower revenues in both Equity markets and 
Fixed income markets, also reflecting lower client activity, 
driven by decreased volatility and a strong prior-year 
comparison. Services revenues were up 21%, driven by higher 
revenues in both TTS and Securities services.

Within Services:

•

•

TTS revenues increased 22%, with growth in net interest 
income of 28% and non-interest revenue of 11%, driven 
by the same factors described above.
Securities services revenues increased 19%, reflecting 
higher net interest income, driven by the same factors 
described above. Non-interest revenue declined 6%, as a 
decrease in revenues in the custody business was partially 
offset by an increase in Issuer services.

Within Markets:

•

•

Fixed income markets revenues decreased 5%, primarily 
due to EMEA, reflecting a decline in spread products and 
other fixed income, driven by the same factors described 
above, as rates and currencies revenues were largely 
unchanged.
Equity markets revenues decreased 18%, primarily due to 
a decline in equity derivatives, driven by the same factors 
as described above, as well as a modest decline in equity 
cash. Prime finance balances continued to grow year to 
date.

The net ACL build was $0.3 billion, compared to $0.7 
billion in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting growth in 
U.S. cards balances. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, 
see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates” below.

For additional information on U.S. Personal Banking’s 

Branded cards, Retail services and Retail banking portfolios, 
see “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit” below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to PBWM’s future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Forward-Looking Statements” below, 
and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-
K.

2Q23 YTD vs. 2Q22 YTD
Year-to-date, PBWM experienced similar trends to those 
described above. Net income was $983 million, compared to 
$2.4 billion in the prior-year period, largely driven by higher 
cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher 
revenues. 

Revenues increased 8%, largely due to higher revenues in 

U.S. Personal Banking. U.S. Personal Banking revenues 
increased 15%, reflecting higher revenues in cards, largely 
driven by the same factors described above. Global Wealth 
revenues decreased 7%, largely driven by the same factors 
described above. 

Expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in Citi’s transformation, other risk and controls 
investments and severance costs, partially offset by 
productivity savings. 

Provisions were $3.2 billion, compared to $1.0 billion in 

the prior-year period, due to a net ACL build for loans, as well 
as higher net credit losses, primarily driven by ongoing 
normalization in U.S. cards. 

The net ACL build was $0.8 billion, primarily driven by 
U.S. cards loan growth, compared to a release of $0.4 billion 
in the prior-year period.

2Q23 vs. 2Q22 
Net income was $494 million, compared to $553 million in the 
prior-year period, driven by higher cost of credit and higher 
expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 6%, primarily due to higher net 

interest income, driven by strong loan growth across U.S. 
Personal Banking. The increase was partially offset by lower 
non-interest revenue, primarily reflecting lower investment 
product revenues in Global Wealth. 

U.S. Personal Banking revenues increased 11%, reflecting 
higher revenues in cards, partially offset by lower revenues in 
Retail banking.

Cards revenues increased 15%. Branded cards revenues 
increased 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income, 
reflecting strength in underlying drivers. Branded cards new 
account acquisitions increased 6% and card spend volumes 
increased 4%. Average loans increased 14%, reflecting the 
higher card spend volumes and lower payment rates.

Retail services revenues increased 27%, primarily driven 

by higher net interest income on higher loan balances and 
lower partner payments. Retail services card spend volumes 
decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower discretionary retail 
spend. Average loans increased 9%, reflecting lower payment 
rates, partially offset by the lower card spend volumes. 

Retail banking revenues decreased 9%, primarily driven 
by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances to Global Wealth. Average loans 
increased 17%, primarily driven by higher mortgage 
originations. Average deposits decreased 3%, largely 
reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances to Global Wealth.

Global Wealth revenues decreased 5%, largely reflecting 
investment product revenue headwinds and lower net interest 
income, partially offset by the benefits of the transfer of 
certain relationships and the associated deposit balances from 
Retail banking. Average deposits and average loans were 
largely unchanged. Client assets increased 5%, primarily 
driven by increases in market valuations. Client advisors 
decreased 1%, reflecting the re-pacing of strategic hiring. 
Private bank revenues decreased 19%, driven by the 
investment product revenue headwinds and higher interest 
rates paid on deposits. Wealth at Work revenues increased 
32%, driven by strong lending results, primarily in mortgages, 
and Citigold revenues decreased 2%, driven by the lower net 
interest income and the lower investment product revenue. 
Expenses increased 5%, largely driven by risk and 
controls investments, partially offset by productivity savings.
Provisions were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in 

the prior-year period, largely driven by higher net credit 
losses, partially offset by a lower net ACL build for loans. Net 
credit losses increased 78%, reflecting ongoing normalization 
in U.S. cards from near historically low levels, with Branded 
cards net credit losses up 87% to $614 million and Retail 
services net credit losses up 88% to $545 million. Both 
Branded cards and Retail services net credit losses are 
expected to normalize by the end of 2023.

LEGACY FRANCHISES

As of June 30, 2023, Legacy Franchises included (i) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), representing the consumer banking 
operations of the remaining six Asia and EMEA exit countries, (ii) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small 
Business and Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, and (iii) Legacy Holdings Assets 
(certain North America consumer mortgage loans and other legacy assets). Asia Consumer provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to retail and small business customers. Mexico Consumer/SBMM provides traditional retail banking and 
branded card products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to 
commercial customers through Citibanamex. 

Legacy Franchises also included the following seven consumer banking businesses prior to their sale: Australia, until its closing 
on June 1, 2022; the Philippines, until its closing on August 1, 2022; Thailand and Malaysia, until their closings on November 1, 2022; 
Bahrain, until its closing on December 1, 2022; and India and Vietnam, until their closings on March 1, 2023. 

In addition, Citi has entered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Indonesia and Taiwan, and has continued 
to make progress on its wind-downs of consumer banking operations in Korea and China and consumer banking and local commercial 
banking operations in Russia (see below). See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises’ consumer banking business 
sales and wind-downs. 

In May 2023, Citi announced it intends to pursue an IPO of consumer, small business and middle-market banking operations in 
Mexico. Citi will retain its ICG and Private bank businesses in Mexico. Citi currently expects that the separation of the businesses will 
be completed in the second half of 2024 and that the IPO will take place in 2025. 

In connection with Citi’s wind-down of its consumer and local commercial banking businesses in Russia, Citi expects to incur 
approximately $140 million in total estimated charges (excluding the impact from any portfolio sales) related to Legacy Franchises. 
Citi’s previously disclosed referral agreement with a Russian bank to settle a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject 
to customer consents, was signed in May 2023. The outstanding card loan balances with Citi ($131 million as of June 30, 2023) are to 
be settled upon referral and refinancing, and the portfolio has not been designated as held-for-sale (HFS). For additional information 
about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see “Institutional Clients Group” above and “Managing 
Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below, as well as “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

At June 30, 2023, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises had 1,413 retail branches, $21 billion in retail banking loans and $53 
billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $9 billion in outstanding card loan balances, and Mexico SBMM had $8 billion in 
outstanding corporate loan balances. These loan and deposit amounts exclude approximately $8 billion of loans ($7 billion of retail 
banking loans and $1 billion of credit card loan balances) and approximately $11 billion of deposits, all of which were reclassified to 
HFS (e.g., as Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as a result of Citi’s entry into agreements to sell 
certain remaining consumer banking businesses. See Note 2 for additional information.

divestiture-related impacts of $(73) million in earnings before 
taxes ($(52) million after-tax), reflecting the following:

•

•

•
•

Consumer, partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico 
Consumer/SBMM and Legacy Holdings Assets. 

Asia Consumer revenues of $454 million decreased from 

$880 million in the prior-year period, mainly driven by the 
reduction from exited markets and continued wind-downs. 
Mexico Consumer/SBMM revenues increased 22%, as 
cards revenues increased 38%, SBMM revenues increased 
25% and retail banking revenues increased 16%, primarily due 
to higher interest rates and higher lending volumes.

costs, including ACL builds/releases and net credit losses, 
are reclassified to revenues
$535 million goodwill impairment, recorded in expenses, 
due to the re-segmentation and sequencing of divestitures
$(76) million of related tax benefits

Legacy Holdings Assets revenues of $20 million 

Revenues increased 24%, driven by higher revenues in 

increased from $(129) million in the prior-year period, largely 
driven by a release of a CTA loss (net of hedges) recorded in 
AOCI in the second quarter of 2022.

Expenses decreased 2%, mainly driven by the impact of 

the exited markets and continued wind-downs. 

Provisions were $300 million, compared to $121 million 
in the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net credit 
losses and a net ACL build. Net credit losses increased 43% to 
$190 million, driven by higher lending volumes in Mexico 
Consumer. The build for credit losses was $110 million, 

Asia Consumer, Mexico Consumer/SBMM and Legacy 
Holdings Assets. 

Asia Consumer revenues increased 18%, primarily driven 
by the India gain on sale, partially offset by the reduction from 
exited markets and wind-downs. Mexico Consumer/SBMM 
revenues increased 19%, mainly due to the benefit of FX 
translation as well as higher interest rates and higher lending 
volumes. Legacy Holdings Assets revenues of $41 million 
increased from $(124) million in the prior-year period, 
primarily driven by the release of the CTA loss (net of hedges)

Expenses decreased 14%, mainly driven by the absence of 

the goodwill impairment in the prior-year period and the 
benefit of the closed exit markets and wind-downs.

Provisions were $645 million, compared to $281 million 
in the prior-year period, driven by higher lending volumes and 
net credit losses in Mexico Consumer, and a build for transfer 
risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by 
safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

2Q23 YTD vs. 2Q22 YTD
Year-to-date, Corporate/Other experienced similar trends to 
those described above. Net income was $611 million, 
compared to net income of $239 million in the prior-year 
period, largely driven by the same factors described above.

Revenues were $1.6 billion, compared to $445 million in 

the prior-year period, driven by the same factors described 
above. 

Expenses were $612 million, compared to $420 million in 

the prior-year period, driven by the same factors described 
above.

Provisions were a $2 million benefit, as the reserve build 
for the First Republic Bank deposit in the first quarter of 2023 
was released in the second quarter of 2023.

2Q23 vs. 2Q22
Net income was $356 million, compared to $50 million in the 
prior-year period. The increase in net income was primarily 
driven by higher revenues, benefits from cost of credit and the 
prior-year release of a CTA loss (net of hedges) from AOCI 
(for additional information, see Note 2). These increases were 
partially offset by higher expenses and lower income tax 
benefits. Results for the quarter also included a $40 million 
withholding tax related to an exit market, which is a 
divestiture-related impact.

Revenues were $677 million, compared to $255 million in 

the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net interest 
income from Deposits with banks and the investment 
portfolio, largely due to higher interest rates. 

Expenses were $302 million, compared to $160 million in 

the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the impact of 
inflation, higher severance costs and the absence of certain 
settlements that occurred in the prior-year period, partially 
offset by lower consulting expenses. 

Provisions were a $113 million benefit, primarily driven 

by a reserve release related to the repayment of the First 
Republic Bank deposit.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to Corporate/Other’s future results, see

Stress Capital Buffer 
In July 2023, the FRB confirmed Citi’s Stress Capital Buffer 
(SCB) requirement of 4.3%, as compared to the current 
requirement of 4.0%, for the four-quarter window starting 
from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024.

Accordingly, effective October 1, 2023, Citi will be 
required to maintain a 12.3% CET1 Capital ratio under the 
Standardized Approach, incorporating the 4.3% SCB and its 
current GSIB surcharge of 3.5%. Citi’s required regulatory 
CET1 Capital ratio under the Advanced Approaches (using the 
fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) will remain 
unchanged at 10.5%. The SCB applies to Citigroup only; the 
regulatory capital framework applicable to Citibank, including 
the Capital Conservation Buffer, is unaffected by Citigroup’s 
SCB. 

For additional information regarding regulatory capital 

buffers, including the SCB and GSIB surcharge, see “Capital 
Resources—Regulatory Capital Buffers” in Citi’s 2022 Form 
10-K. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES

For additional information about capital resources, including 
Citi’s capital management, regulatory capital buffers, the 
stress testing component of capital planning and current 
regulatory capital standards and developments, see “Capital 
Resources” and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

During the second quarter of 2023, Citi returned a total of 
$2.0 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of 
$1.0 billion in dividends and $1.0 billion in share repurchases 
totaling approximately 21 million common shares. For 
additional information, see “Unregistered Sales of Equity 
Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends” 
below. 

Citi paid common dividends of $0.51 per share for the 

second quarter of 2023, and on July 20, 2023, declared 
common dividends of $0.53 per share for the third quarter of 
2023. Citi intends to maintain a quarterly common dividend of 
at least $0.53 per share, subject to financial and 
macroeconomic conditions as well as its Board of Directors’ 
approval. In addition, as previously announced, Citi will 
continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-
quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital 
requirements. For additional information, see “Capital 
Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments” 
below.

Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the 
Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.4% as of June 30, 
2023, largely unchanged from March 31, 2023, relative to a 
required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.0% as of such 
dates under the Standardized Approach. This compares to a 
CET1 Capital ratio of 13.0% as of December 31, 2022, 
relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 11.5% 
as of such date under the Standardized Approach.

Citi’s CET1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced 

Approaches was 12.5% as of June 30, 2023, compared to 
12.3% as of March 31, 2023, relative to a required regulatory 
CET1 Capital ratio of 10.5% as of such dates under the 
Advanced Approaches framework. This compares to a CET1 
Capital ratio of 12.2% as of December 31, 2022, relative to a 
required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.0% as of such 
date under the Advanced Approaches.

Citi’s CET1 Capital ratio under the Standardized 

Approach remained largely unchanged from March 31, 2023, 
as the return of capital to common shareholders and an 
increase in RWA were offset by net income. Citi’s CET1 
Capital ratio increased under the Advanced Approaches from 
March 31, 2023, driven primarily by net income and a 
decrease in RWA, partially offset by the return of capital to 
common shareholders.

Citi’s CET1 Capital ratio increased under both the 
Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches from year-
end 2022, driven primarily by year-to-date net income of $7.5 
billion, partially offset by the return of capital to common 
shareholders and an increase in RWA.

Issuance costs of $136 million and $131 million related to outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 
respectively, were excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory 
reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP. 

(2) Citi’s regulatory capital ratios and components reflect certain deferrals based on the modified regulatory capital transition provision related to the CECL standard. 
For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology” in 
Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.
Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.

(4) Of Citi’s $28.5 billion of net DTAs at June 30, 2023, $11.5 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax 
carry-forwards, as well as $1.8 billion of DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded 10%/15% limitations, were excluded from Citi’s CET1 Capital 
as of June 30, 2023. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted 
from CET1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences are required to be deducted from capital only if they exceed 10%/15% 
limitations under the U.S. Basel III rules.

(5) Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated 
financial institutions. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% 
limitation.

(6) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. 
(7) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any 
excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which 
eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of 
credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject 
to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework were $4.9 billion and $4.7 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

(1) General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases. General credit risk exposures increased 
during the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in card activities. General credit risk exposures decreased during the six months ended 
June 30, 2023, primarily driven by divestitures and non-strategic portfolio exits.

(2) Derivative exposures increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, mainly driven by movements across multiple business areas, notably in rates 

and currencies.

(3) Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. Repo-style 

transactions increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, mainly due to increased activities across multiple business areas.

(4) Equity exposures increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in investment market share prices.
(5) Other exposures increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, mainly driven by increases in other assets.
(6) Market risk-weighted assets decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to exposure changes, partially offset by changes in 

model inputs related to volatility and correlation between market risk factors.

For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology” in 
Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 

(3) Represents the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter. 
(4) Under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations are required to include in Total Leverage Exposure the effective notional amount of sold credit derivatives, 

with netting of exposures permitted if certain conditions are met. 

(5) Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. 

As presented in the table above, Citigroup’s 

Supplementary Leverage ratio was approximately 6.0% at 
June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023, compared to 
approximately 5.8% at December 31, 2022. The ratio 
remained largely unchanged from the first quarter of 2023. 
The ratio increased from the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily 
driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital due to year-to-date net 
income of $7.5 billion, partially offset by an increase in Total 
Leverage Exposure, largely driven by higher average on-
balance sheet assets.

(1) Citibank’s required risk-based capital ratios are inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (all of which must be composed of CET1 Capital).
(2) Citibank’s regulatory capital ratios and components reflect certain deferrals based on the modified regulatory capital transition provision related to the CECL 

standard. For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses 
Methodology” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

(3) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any 
excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which 
eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of 
credit risk-weighted assets. 

(4) Citibank’s binding CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods 

presented.

(5) Citibank must maintain required CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered 
“well capitalized” under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions as established by the U.S. Basel III 
rules. Citibank must also maintain a required Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered “well capitalized.” 

(6) Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 
(7) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

As indicated in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at 

June 30, 2023 were in excess of the regulatory capital 
requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, 
Citibank was “well capitalized” as of June 30, 2023.
As presented in the table above, Citibank’s 

Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.1% at June 30, 2023 and 
7.0% at March 31, 2023, compared to 6.9% at December 31, 
2022. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven 

by an increase in Tier 1 Capital due to net income in the 
second quarter of 2023, partially offset by dividends, and a 
decrease in Total Leverage Exposure, primarily driven by 
higher average on-balance sheet assets. The year-to-date 
increase was primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital 
due to net income in 2023, partially offset by dividends, and a 
decrease in Total Leverage Exposure, primarily driven by 
higher average on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet 
exposures.

Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios 
The following tables present the estimated sensitivity of 
Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 
million in CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital 
(numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced 
Approaches and Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets 
and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total 
Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of June 30, 2023. This 
information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the 
impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank’s financial 
position or results of operations could have on these ratios. 
These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a 
component of capital, risk-weighted assets, quarterly adjusted 
average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, 
an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger 
basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.

Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries
At June 30, 2023, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. 
broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect 
wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, 
computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of 
$15 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $11 
billion. 

Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-

dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential 
Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly 
owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total regulatory capital of 
$27 billion at June 30, 2023, which exceeded the PRA’s 
minimum regulatory capital requirements. 

In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer 

subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which 
they do business, including requirements to maintain specified 
levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other 
principal broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with 
their regulatory capital requirements at June 30, 2023.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) 
The table below details Citi’s eligible external TLAC and

surplus above its binding TLAC requirement of LTD as a 
percentage of Total Leverage Exposure.

GSIB Surcharge
Separately, the FRB proposed changes to the GSIB surcharge 
rule that aim to make it more risk sensitive. Proposed changes 
include measuring certain systemic indicators on a daily 
versus quarterly average basis, changing certain of the risk 
indicators, and shortening the time to come into compliance 
with each year’s surcharge. In addition, the proposal would 
narrow surcharge bands under method 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps 
to reduce cliff effects when moving between bands. This 
proposal is also subject to a 120-day comment period and 
provides that it would be effective two full calendar quarters 
after its finalization.

Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments

Basel III Revisions
On July 27, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a notice of 
proposed rulemaking, known as the Basel III Endgame 
(capital proposal), that would amend U.S. regulatory capital 
requirements.

The capital proposal would maintain the current capital 

rule’s dual-requirement structure for risk-weighted assets but 
would eliminate the use of internal models to calculate credit 
risk and operational risk components of risk-weighted assets. 
Large banking organizations, such as Citi, would be required 
to calculate their risk-based capital ratios under both the new 
expanded risk-based approach and the Standardized Approach 
and use the lower of the two for each risk-based capital ratio 
for determining the binding constraints. 

The expanded risk-based approach is designed to align 
with the international capital standards adopted by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee). The 
Basel Committee finalized the Basel III reforms in December 
2017, which included revisions to the methodologies to 
determine credit, market and operational risk-weighted asset 
amounts.

If adopted as proposed, the capital proposal’s impact on 
risk-weighted asset amounts would also affect several other 
requirements including TLAC, external long-term debt and the 
short-term wholesale funding score included in the GSIB 
surcharge under method 2 (see “GSIB Surcharge” below for 
additional changes in that area). The proposal has a three-year 
transition period that would begin on July 1, 2025. Citi is 
currently reviewing the proposal and will participate in the 
120-day comment period. For additional information, see 
“Executive Summary” above.

     33                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, 
Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity
Tangible common equity (TCE), as defined by Citi, represents 
common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and identifiable 
intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights 
(MSRs)). Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) 
represents annualized net income available to common 
shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. Tangible book 
value per share (TBVPS) represents average TCE divided by 
average common shares outstanding. Other companies may 
calculate these measures differently. TCE, RoTCE and 
TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

End-of-period loans increased 1% year-over-year, as 
growth in PBWM, reflecting an increase in U.S. Personal 
Banking, was largely offset by declines in ICG and Legacy 
Franchises. End-of-period loans increased 1% sequentially. 

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK

For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management 
process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. 
Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks 
those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership 
Principles that support it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. For 
more information on managing global risk at Citi, see 
“Managing Global Risk” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

CREDIT RISK

For more information on credit risk, including Citi’s credit risk 
management, measurement and stress testing, and Citi’s 
consumer and corporate credit portfolios, see “Credit Risk” 
and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

(1) See footnote 2 to the table in “Credit Risk—Consumer Credit—

Consumer Credit Portfolio” below.

Citi’s loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer 
and corporate loans, with an aggregate duration of 1.2 years, 
as a majority of loans are at variable rates.

On an average basis, loans were largely unchanged year-
over-year and sequentially as growth in PBWM was offset by a 
decline in ICG and Legacy Franchises. PBWM average loans 
increased 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by loan growth 
in cards, mortgages and installment lending. ICG average 
loans decreased 6% year-over-year, reflecting actions taken to 
reduce RWA. Legacy Franchises average loans decreased 
14%, primarily reflecting the impact of the continued wind-
downs, particularly in Korea, partially offset by higher lending 
volumes in Mexico Consumer. 

     36

Portfolio Mix—Geography and Counterparty
Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography 
and counterparty. The following table presents the percentage 
of this portfolio by region based on Citi’s internal 
management geography:

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and 
internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated 
statistical models and scorecards in combination with 
consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such 
as management experience, competitive position, regulatory 
environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are 
assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor 
and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, 
such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that 
generally correspond to BBB and above are considered 
investment grade, while those below are considered non-
investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio 

by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate 
credit portfolio:

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and 
adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and 
non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or 
changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic 
environment. 

Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of June 30, 2023. Citi has 
taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of 
exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and 
obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where 
additional stress has been seen. 

     37                                                                                                                                                                                                            

     
 
 
 
 
As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the 
incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to 
reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will 
continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate 
probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.
See Note 13 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

(1)  Excludes $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at June 30, 2023, respectively, primarily related to the delinquency-managed loans. 

Funded balances also exclude loans carried at fair value of $5.5 billion at June 30, 2023. 
Includes non-accrual loan exposures and criticized unfunded exposures.

(2) 
(3)  Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $38.5 billion of 

purchased credit protection, $35.9 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $2.6 
billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $20.9 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the 
first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.

(4)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of 
global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $16.9 billion ($8.7 billion in funded, with 100% rated 
investment grade) as of June 30, 2023.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of June 30, 2023, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $4.8 billion, of which approximately $2.4 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.

(5) 

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of June 30, 2023, Citi’s total credit exposure to commercial 
real estate (CRE) was $66 billion (unchanged from March 31, 
2023), including $8 billion of exposure related to office 
buildings. This total CRE exposure consisted of (i) 
approximately $55 billion related to corporate clients 
(unchanged from March 31, 2023), mainly included in the real 
estate category in the table above, and (ii) approximately $11 
billion related to Private bank clients (unchanged from 
March 31, 2023) within PBWM that is not in the table above 
as they are not considered corporate exposures. 

In addition, as of June 30, 2023, approximately 87% of 

Citi’s total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and 
more than 76% was to borrowers in the U.S.

As of June 30, 2023, the ACLL attributed to the total 

funded CRE exposure (including the Private bank) was

(1)  Excludes $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily related to the delinquency-managed loans. 

Funded balances also exclude loans carried at fair value of $5.1 billion at December 31, 2022. 
Includes non-accrual loan exposures and criticized unfunded exposures.

(2) 
(3)  Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $39.8 billion of 

purchased credit protection, $36.6 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $3.2 
billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional of $27.6 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the 
first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.

(4)  Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of 
global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $17.4 billion ($10.3 billion in funded, with more than 
99% rated investment grade) as of December 31, 2022.
In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and 
industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December 31, 2022, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was 
approximately $4.7 billion, of which approximately $2.4 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives and other risk mitigants to hedge 
portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in 
addition to outright asset sales. Citi may enter into partial-term 
hedges as well as full-term hedges. In advance of the 
expiration of partial-term hedges, Citi will determine, among 
other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the 
remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-
market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives 
are reflected primarily in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

At June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and Dec 31, 2022, ICG 
had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $38.5 
billion, $39.8 billion and $39.8 billion, respectively. Citi’s 
expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL 
does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and 
other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the 
reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of 
these hedging transactions. The credit protection was 
economically hedging underlying ICG corporate credit 
portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:

(1) End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) Asia Consumer loan balances, reported within Legacy Franchises, exclude any loans reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) as of the date Citi enters into a sale 

agreement for the respective Asia Consumer banking business. These reclassified HFS loans are instead reported in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet until sale closing. The remaining Asia Consumer loan portfolios—China, Korea, Russia and Poland—are held-for-investment and included in end-of-period 
consumer loans for all periods presented. All HFS portfolios were reclassified prior to the end of 1Q22 except for a $1.8 billion portfolio, which was moved to 
HFS in 1Q23.

(3) Consists of $99.5 billion, $98.9 billion, $98.2 billion, $99.3 billion and $94.6 billion of loans in North America as of June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 
31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, see Note 13.
(4) Consists of $51.0 billion, $51.0 billion, $51.0 billion, $51.8 billion and $54.2 billion of loans outside North America as of June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, 

December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.

(5) See Note 13 for details on loan-to-value ratios for the portfolios and FICO scores for the U.S. portfolio.
(6) At June 30, 2023, includes approximately $48 billion of classifiably managed loans. Over 90% of these loans are fully collateralized (consisting primarily of 

marketable investment securities, commercial real estate and limited partner capital commitments in private equity) and have experienced very low historical net 
credit losses (NCLs). As discussed below, approximately 97% of the classifiably managed portion of these loans are investment grade. See “Consumer Loan 
Delinquencies Amounts and Ratios” below for details on the delinquency-managed portfolio.
(7) Asia Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.
(8) Primarily consists of certain North America consumer mortgages.

For information on changes to Citi’s consumer loans, see

Consumer Credit Trends

Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM)

Personal Banking and Wealth Management

As indicated above, PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking 
and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth). U.S. 
Personal Banking provides card products through Branded 
cards and Retail services, and also includes mortgages and 
home equity, small business and personal consumer loans 
through Citi’s Retail banking network. The Retail bank is 
concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. Global 
Wealth provides investment services, cards, mortgages and 
personal, small business and other consumer loans through the 
Private bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. 

As of June 30, 2023, 44% of PBWM consumer loans 
consisted of U.S. cards loans. U.S. cards net credit losses 
represented approximately 93% of total PBWM losses. 

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2023 
net credit loss rate in PBWM increased quarter-over-quarter 
and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in net flow 
rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization from recent 
low levels in U.S. cards.

PBWM’s 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year. The 
year-over-year increase was largely driven by a continued 
increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization in U.S. cards.

Branded Cards

U.S. Personal Banking’s Branded cards portfolio includes 

proprietary and co-branded cards. 

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2023 

net credit loss rate in Branded cards increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting ongoing normalization 
toward pre-pandemic levels from recent low levels (for 
example, the 4Q’19 and 1Q’20 net credit loss rates were 
3.10% and 3.40%, respectively).

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter and year-over-year, also driven by a continued 
increase in net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing 
normalization toward pre-pandemic levels from recent low 
levels (for example, the 4Q’19 and 1Q’20 90+ days past due 
delinquency rates were 0.95% and 1.01%, respectively). 

Retail Services

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail services partners directly 

with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label 
and co-branded cards. Retail services’ target market focuses 
on select industry segments such as home improvement, 
specialty retail, consumer electronics and fuel. Retail services 
continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within 
target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment 
programs and growth potential.

As shown in the chart above, the second quarter of 2023 

net credit loss rate in Retail services increased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, driven by a continued increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization 
toward pre-pandemic levels from recent low levels (for 
example, the 4Q’19 and 1Q’20 net credit loss rates were 
5.05% and 5.35%, respectively). 

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter, and increased year-over-year. The 
year-over-year increase was driven by a continued increase in 
net flow rates, primarily reflecting the ongoing normalization 
(for example, the 4Q’19 and 1Q’20 90+ days past due 
delinquency rates were 1.91% and 1.96%, respectively).

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 

delinquency and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios, 
see each respective business’s results of operations above and 
Note 13.

     43                                                                                                                                                                                                            

classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit 
risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 97% is rated 
investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart 
above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed 
portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit 
losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed 
portfolios.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss and 90+ 

days past due delinquency rates in Global Wealth for the 
second quarter of 2023 were broadly stable quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year. The low levels of net credit losses 
and the 90+ days past due delinquency rate continued to 
reflect the strong credit profiles of the portfolios. 

Legacy Franchises

Asia(1) Consumer

(1) Asia Consumer includes Legacy Franchises activities in certain EMEA 

countries for all periods presented.

Asia Consumer provides credit cards, consumer 
mortgages and small business and personal loans. Asia 
Consumer also includes loans and leases in certain EMEA 
countries for all periods presented.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Asia Consumer (for the remaining consumer banking 
portfolios held-for-investment (China, Korea, Russia and 
Poland)) for the second quarter of 2023 increased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year. The increases were primarily 
driven by lower average loans due to the ongoing wind-downs 
of the remaining businesses, particularly Korea, and the 
reclassification of a portfolio to HFS in the first quarter of 
2023.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was unchanged 

quarter-over-quarter and increased year-over-year, mainly 
driven by lower loans due to the ongoing wind-downs of the 
remaining businesses and the reclassification of a portfolio to 
HFS in the first quarter of 2023. The overall performance of 
the remaining Asia Consumer portfolios continues to reflect 
the strong credit profiles of the customer segments.

Retail Banking

U.S. Personal Banking’s Retail banking portfolio consists 
primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and 
unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and 
personal loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency 
managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO 
scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. 
The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically 
been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with 
loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first 
and second mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-
to-Value (LTV) Ratios” in Note 13.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Retail banking for the second quarter of 2023 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, due to a decrease in overdraft losses, and 
decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of 
industry-wide episodic overdraft losses in the prior-year 
period.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased 
quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by 
lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages, which reflected the 
lasting effects of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and consumer relief programs.

Global Wealth

As discussed above, the Global Wealth credit portfolio 
primarily consists of consumer mortgages, cards and other 
lending products extended to customer segments that range 
from the affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through the Private 
bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. These customer segments 
represent a target market that is characterized by historically 
low default rates and delinquencies. 

As of June 30, 2023, approximately $48 billion, or 32%, 

of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily 
consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, 
subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These 

     44                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides cards, consumer mortgages and 
small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a 
more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As shown in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 
Mexico Consumer for the second quarter of 2023 decreased 
quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher recoveries in the 
second quarter of 2023, and increased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the gradual normalization of loss rates 
after peak losses experienced during the pandemic.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate increased quarter-

over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by the gradual 
normalization of delinquency rates after peak delinquencies 
during the pandemic.

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Note 13.

U.S. Cards FICO Distribution
The following tables present the current FICO score 
distributions for Citi’s Branded cards and Retail services 
portfolios based on end-of-period receivables. FICO scores are 
updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio and on a 
quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.

(1)  The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer 

presentations. 

The FICO distribution of both card portfolios trended up 

from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonal portfolio quality 
improvements, and declined from the prior year, reflecting the 
ongoing normalization in net credit loss and delinquency rates 
in both portfolios. The FICO distribution continued to reflect 
strong underlying credit quality and benefits from the 
continued impacts of government stimulus, unemployment 
benefits and customer relief programs. See Note 13 for 
additional information on FICO scores.

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $73 million ($0.5 billion), $80 million ($0.6 billion) and $119 million ($0.7 billion) at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The 
amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $68 
million, $57 million and $72 million at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card 

loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios. 
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and 
therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, 97%, 93% and 94% of Global Wealth 
classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Global Wealth portfolio, including classifiably 
managed portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS in 

Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22 (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and 
Vietnam closed in 1Q23). In addition, a portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. See Note 2 for additional information.

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and 
(EOP loans) were $77 million ($0.2 billion), $81 million ($0.3 billion) and $84 million ($0.2 billion) at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, 
respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP 
loans) were $31 million, $30 million and $27 million at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the 
guaranteed loans.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $769 million, $748 million, $712 million, $671 million and $631 million at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, 

December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees 
and costs, premiums and discounts. 

(4) Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of $(795) million, $(801) million, $(797) million, $(750) million and $(759) million 
at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily 
represents interest received in advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(5) Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets 
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and 
assets, see “Non-Accrual Loans and Assets” in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Approximately 51%, 61%, 50%, 68% and 52% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans were performing at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, 

September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively.

(3) The June 30, 2023 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.44% of total corporate loans.
(4)  Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries for all periods presented.

Modified Loans
On January 1, 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-02, which 
eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for 
TDRs (see Note 1 for additional information). See Note 13 for 
information on loan modifications during the six months 
ended June 30, 2023.

Note: The amounts shown in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be 
realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates 
various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)  Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Korea, Mexico, 
India and Singapore. 

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held 
at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion 
in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity 
Coverage ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These 
amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum 
requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess 
of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other 
entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s total average HQLA as 
of the second quarter of 2023 remained largely unchanged 
sequentially. 

As of June 30, 2023, Citigroup had approximately $993 
billion of available liquidity resources to support client and 
business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($591 billion); 
additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess liquidity 
held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities 
within Citigroup ($212 billion); and unused borrowing 
capacity from available assets not already accounted for within 
Citi’s HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal 
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank 
discount window ($190 billion).

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The 
table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation 
and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.

As of June 30, 2023, Citigroup’s average LCR decreased, 

from the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was 
primarily driven by the reduction in unsecured long-term debt. 
In addition, considering Citi’s total available liquidity 

resources at quarter end of $993 billion, Citi maintained 
approximately $501 billion of excess liquidity above the 
stressed average net outflow of approximately $492 billion, 
shown in the LCR table above.

     54                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
Citi’s deposit base is spread across a diversified set of 

countries, industries, clients and currencies. 

On an average basis, deposits increased 1% year-over-
year and were down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year 
increase primarily reflected an increase in Corporate/Other 
and ICG, partially offset by a decline in PBWM. Corporate/
Other average deposits increased $12 billion year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the issuance of institutional certificates of 
deposit. ICG average deposits increased 1% year-over-year, 
driven by TTS. PBWM average deposits decreased 1% year-
over-year, largely reflecting the reallocation of deposits to 
higher-yielding investments. Legacy Franchises average 
deposits were largely unchanged year-over-year. The quarter-
over-quarter decrease was largely driven by TTS, reflecting 
some non-operational outflows as expected in light of 
quantitative tightening, and Corporate/Other. Despite this 
decline, TTS had strong growth in operating accounts as the 
business continued to attract new clients and deepen existing 
relationships. 

End-of-period deposits were largely unchanged year-over-

year, as an increase in institutional certificates of deposit in 
Corporate/Other was offset by a decrease in ICG, driven by 
Securities services. End-of-period deposits decreased 1% 
sequentially, reflecting seasonal activity in TTS and Global 
Wealth. 

The majority of Citi’s $1.3 trillion of end-of-period 
deposits are institutional (approximately $818 billion), and 
span approximately 90 countries. A large majority of these 
institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, 
approximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS 
integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity 
management and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly 
80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a greater than 
15-year relationship with Citi. Over the past year, TTS 
deposits grew at a faster rate than total Citi deposits on both an 
average and end-of-period basis. Citi also has a strong 
consumer and wealth deposit base, with $427 billion of U.S. 
Retail banking and Global Wealth deposits as of end-of-
period, which are diversified across the Private bank, Citigold, 
Retail banking and Wealth at Work. As of year-end 2022, 
approximately 75% of U.S. Citigold clients have been with 
Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 50% of Private 
bank ultra-high-net-worth clients have been with Citi for more 
than 10 years. U.S. Personal Banking deposits are spread 
across six core urban centers.

Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR)
As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding against 
a required level. 

The rule became effective beginning July 1, 2021, while 

public disclosure of the ratio is required to occur on a 
semiannual basis beginning as of June 30, 2023. Citi was in 
compliance with the rule as of June 30, 2023.

Select Balance Sheet Items
This section provides details of select liquidity-related 
liabilities reported on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet 
on an average and end-of-period basis.

Cash and Investments
The table below details average and end-of-period Cash and 
due from banks, Deposits with banks (collectively cash) and 
Investment securities. Citi’s investment portfolio consists 
largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other 
sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three 
years. At June 30, 2023, Citi’s EOP cash and Investment 
securities comprised approximately 33% of Citigroup’s total 
assets:

Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also 
included in this line.

(2) Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3) Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded 

cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 7% year-
over-year, largely driven by the issuance of customer-related 
debt at the non-bank entities and increased FHLB borrowings 
at the bank. The increase was partially offset by the decline in 
senior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities, as well as 
lower securitizations at the bank. Sequentially, long-term debt 
outstanding decreased 2%, largely driven by a decline in 
senior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities. 

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
the second quarter of 2023, Citi redeemed or repurchased an 
aggregate of approximately $8.9 billion of its outstanding 
long-term debt. 

Long-Term Debt 

Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) 
The following table presents Citigroup and its affiliates’ 
(including Citibank) WAM of unsecured long-term debt 
issued with a remaining life greater than one year:

The WAM is calculated based on the contractual maturity 

of each security. For securities that are redeemable prior to 
maturity at the option of the holder, the WAM is calculated 
based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable.

Long-Term Debt Outstanding
Citi’s long-term debt outstanding at the Citigroup parent 
company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt 
and what Citi refers to as customer-related debt, consisting of 
structured notes, such as equity- and credit-linked notes, as 
well as non-structured notes. Citi’s issuance of customer-
related debt is generally driven by customer demand and 
complements benchmark debt issuance as a source of funding 
for Citi’s non-bank entities. Citi’s long-term debt at the bank 
includes bank notes, FHLB advances and securitizations.

consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and

(1) Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $40 billion as of the second 
quarter of 2023 was largely unchanged both year-over-year 
and sequentially (see Note 17 for further information on 
Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term 
borrowings).

Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term 
Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through 
Citi’s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Secured 
funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of 
Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in 
secured lending activity in the matched book (as described 
below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to 
maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by 
establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress 
tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, 
collateral type, counterparty and client actions. 

Secured funding of $260 billion as of June 30, 2023 
increased 31% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, largely 
driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-
related assets within Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of 
the quarter ended June 30, 2023, on an average basis, secured 
funding was $262 billion. The portion of secured funding in 
the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is 
commonly referred to as “matched book” activity and is 
primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. 
Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign 
government debt securities. Other “matched book” activity is 
secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, 
corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of 
which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the 
corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining 
portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities.

     58                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Credit Ratings
The table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of June 30, 2023. While not included in the table 
below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup 
Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch, 
A2/P-1 at Moody’s Investors Service and A/A-1 at S&P 
Global Ratings as of June 30, 2023.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

For additional information on the impact of credit rating 

changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk 
Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of June 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-
notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.4 billion, compared to $0.3 
billion as of March 31, 2023. Other funding sources, such as 
secured funding transactions and other margin requirements, 
for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be 
adversely affected.

As of June 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citibank across all three major rating agencies could impact 
Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by 
approximately $0.4 billion, compared to $0.3 billion as of 
March 31, 2023. Other funding sources, such as secured 
funding transactions and other margin requirements, for which 
there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely 
impacted.

In total, as of June 30, 2023, Citi estimates that a one-
notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$0.8 billion, compared to $0.6 billion as of March 31, 2023 
(see also Note 21). As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid 
Assets (HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity 
resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as 
a contingency for the potential events described above.

Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
June 30, 2023, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $10.9 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, which was largely unchanged 
from March 31, 2023 (see Note 20 for additional information).
In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could reevaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. This 
reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading 
portfolios. For additional information on market risk and 
market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk—
Overview” and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly 
from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on 
Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) 
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from 
non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of 
changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in 
foreign currencies.

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are 
referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate 
risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading 
Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset & Liability 
Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related 
limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are 
subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. 
Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well 
as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking 
Book interest rate risk management is also subject to 
independent oversight from the second line of defense team 
reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI 

and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking 
Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk 
factors, including:

•

•
•

•

Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments;
Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates 
(e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from 
changes in the interest rate environment.

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses 
generate interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-
facing products, such as loans and deposits. The component of 
this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via 
Citi’s funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. 
Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total 
interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite 
and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment 
securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate 
derivatives. 

In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its 
Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) 
is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios 
on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other 
interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not 
represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in 

this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in 
response to changes in the market environment, changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi’s 
modeling and other factors.

Since the third quarter of 2022, Citi has employed 

enhanced IRE methodologies and changes to certain 
assumptions. The changes included, among other things, 
assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions 
to the treatment of certain business contributions (notably 
accrual positions in ICG’s Markets businesses). These changes 
resulted in a higher impact to Citi’s net interest income over a 
12-month period.

Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most 
recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its 
composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the 
balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations 
and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage 
prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in 
each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market 
implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios 
assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do 
not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response 
to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest 
rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate 
scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas), are 
informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit 
pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these 
forecasts.

Citi’s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the 

following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client 
deposits, Citi’s deposits with other banks, investment 
securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and 
the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and 
credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from 
any positions that are included in total trading and credit 
portfolio VAR.

In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value 
sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. 
EVS is a net present value (NPV)–based measure of the 
lifetime cash flows of Citi’s Banking Book. It estimates the 
interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book’s economic value 
from longer-term assets being potentially funded with shorter-
term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk 
limits approved by Citigroup’s Board of Directors that are 
aligned with Citi’s interest rate risk appetite.

     60                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on 
AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to 
manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest 
rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and 
regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 

changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 
Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity. 

Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to 

reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated 
changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy 
decisions and changes in economic conditions may be 
reflected in current market implied forward rates. The 
following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, 
each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps 
increase in interest rates:

(3)

The “All other currencies” of $1,468 million as of 
June 30, 2023 in the table above includes the impact from the 
following top six non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents 
nearly 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency impact: 
approximately $0.2 billion from British pound sterling, and 
approximately $0.1 billion each from Japanese yen, Singapore 
dollar, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee and Swiss franc. These 
impacts per currency are generally in the same direction 
(estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and 
not offsetting.

Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster 

than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in 
increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock 
scenario as of the second quarter of 2023 decreased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily due to changes in 
deposit composition and levels, partially offset by hedging 
actions. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the 
marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes 
it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., 
higher betas), further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. 
Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet 
factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s 
estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that 

the approximate $1.4 billion initial negative impact to AOCI 
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the 
expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of 
Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income 
benefit over a period of approximately six months.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are 
interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios 
presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-
yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from 
higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.
(1) Scenario 1 includes the impact from the following top six non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents nearly 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency impact: 

approximately $0.2 billion from British pound sterling, and approximately $0.1 million each from Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee and 
Swiss franc. These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and not offsetting.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

As shown in the table above, the estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than 
Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher 
interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For 
non-U.S. dollar currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks 
is smaller in magnitude as a result of Citi’s flooring 
assumption, given low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar 
currencies.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under 

Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

     62                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of June 30, 2023, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.7 billion, or 0.96%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be 
primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, 
Euro and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies. 

In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted
Change in FX spot rate(1)
Change in TCE due to FX translation, net of hedges

As a percentage of TCE

Estimated impact to CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) 
due to changes in FX translation, net of hedges (bps)

This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s CET1 Capital 
ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging 
costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual 
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital 
compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described 
above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the 
quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and CET1 
Capital ratio, are shown in the table below. See Note 18 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%) of $13 million, $44 million and $44 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, 
March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3) The average rate on interest revenue and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4) Citi’s NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest revenue and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income in the second quarter of 2023 
increased 16% to $13.9 billion versus the prior-year period. As 
presented in the table above, Citi’s net interest income on a 
taxable equivalent basis also increased 16% year-over-year, or 
$1.9 billion. The increase was driven by higher net interest 
income in non-ICG Markets, which increased 12%, and ICG 
Markets, which increased 46%. The increase in net interest 
income in non-ICG Markets primarily reflected higher interest 
rates, growth in U.S. cards interest-earning balances and 
higher income from Citi’s investment portfolio, partially offset 
by the reduction from the exited markets and continued wind-
downs in Legacy Franchises. The increase in ICG Markets net 
interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates as 
well as a change in the mix of trading positions in support of 
client activity.

Citi’s net interest margin was 2.48% on a taxable 

equivalent basis in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 7 
basis points from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the 
benefits of dividend seasonality in ICG Markets and higher 
interest rates, partially offset by a mix shift to higher cost 
deposits.

Market Risk of Trading Portfolios

Value at Risk (VAR)
Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the 
most recent month) and long-term (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of June 30, 2023, Citi 
estimates that the conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an approximate 48% add-on to what would be a VAR 
estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of March 31, 2023, the add-on was 65%.

As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VAR for the second quarter of 2023 decreased 3% quarter-over-quarter, 

primarily from inventory changes in ICG Markets businesses.

(1)  Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions in ICG, with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value 

option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)  The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)  The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, with the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all 

associated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges to the 
leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination in ICG.

Regulatory VAR Back-testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

As of June 30, 2023, there was one back-testing exception 

observed for Citi’s Regulatory VAR in the last 12 months.

Citi’s management of other risks, see “Managing Global Risk
—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

LIBOR Transition Risk 
The USD LIBOR bank panel ended on June 30, 2023. The 
overnight and 12-month USD LIBOR settings have now 
permanently ceased, and the Financial Conduct Authority is 
requiring ICE Benchmark Administration to continue 
publishing one-, three- and six-month USD LIBOR settings 
using a synthetic methodology, which is based on the relevant 
CME Term SOFR Reference Rate plus the respective ISDA 
fixed spread adjustment. These synthetic settings are 
permanently unrepresentative of the underlying markets they 
previously sought to measure and are expected to cease on 
September 30, 2024. 

As of June 30, 2023, Citi has transitioned nearly all of its 

USD LIBOR-referencing contracts to SOFR plus a credit 
spread adjustment. Remediation was accomplished through a 
range of methods. With respect to derivatives, most bilateral 
contracts were remediated through adherence to the ISDA 
IBOR Fallbacks Protocols or bilateral amendments, and 
cleared contracts were remediated through conversions 
completed by central counterparty clearing houses. Most loan 
contracts were remediated through amendments that provided 
for either an immediate transition to SOFR or a transition on 
the first interest payment date immediately following June 30, 
2023. With respect to securities, contracts governed by U.S. 
law transitioned to SOFR by operation of law pursuant to the 
Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act or pursuant to Citi’s 
exercise of discretion as the determining person with the 
authority to select a replacement rate. Securities contracts not 
governed by U.S. law were primarily remediated through 
consent solicitations or Citi’s exercise of discretion as the 
determining person with the authority to select a replacement 
rate. 

As of June 30, 2023, there were a de minimis number of 

unremediated USD LIBOR-referencing contracts. Most of 
these contracts relate to non-U.S.-law-governed securities and 
loans that will temporarily utilize synthetic LIBOR. Citi will 
continue to focus on remediating its remaining unremediated 
contracts. 

For additional information about Citi’s actions to address 

a transition away from and discontinuance of LIBOR, see 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—LIBOR Transition 
Risk” in Citi’s First Quarter of 2023 Form 10-Q and 2022 
Form 10-K. For information about Citi’s LIBOR transition 
risks, see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in the 2022 Form 10-
K.

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2023. (Including 
the U.S., Citi’s top 25 exposures by country would represent 
approximately 98% of Citi’s exposure to all countries as of 
June 30, 2023.)

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 

most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 
in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 41% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (42% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 90% of the total U.K. funded loans and 90% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of June 30, 2023. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

Russia 

Introduction
In Russia, Citi’s remaining wind-down operations are 
conducted through both its ICG and Legacy Franchises 
segments. 

As previously disclosed, as of March 31, 2023, Citi ended 

nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in 
Russia, with the remaining services only those necessary to 
fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In 
addition, Legacy Franchises reduced its loan portfolios in 
Russia by approximately 75%, primarily driven by loan 
portfolio sales and the signing of a credit card referral 
agreement. Citi has ceased soliciting any new business or new 
clients in Russia. Citi will continue to manage its existing 
legal and regulatory commitments and obligations, as well as 
support its employees, during this period. For additional 
information, see “Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations” 
below.

Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related 
sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate 
its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate. 

For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its 
Russia exposures, see “Forward-Looking Statements” below 
and “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risk,” “—Operational 
Risks” and “—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Russia-related Balance Sheet Exposures 
Citi’s remaining domestic operations in Russia are conducted 
through a subsidiary of Citibank, AO Citibank, which uses the 
Russian ruble as its functional currency.

Investment securities include debt securities AFS, recorded at fair market value, primarily local government debt securities. 

(1) 
(2)  Reverse repurchase agreements are shown gross of collateral and are included in net MTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of collateral for 

Russia-related reverse repurchase agreements was removed in the second quarter of 2022. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with a well-founded 
basis, the enforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal system in the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the 
war in Ukraine.

(3)  Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
(4)  Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia.
(5)  Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Deposit 

Insurance Agency (DIA). In accordance with a Central Bank of Russia regulatory requirement, all balances in the National Settlements Depository were 
transferred to the DIA. Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government.

(6)  The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures was funded with the dividends under footnote 5 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and 

personal banking clients.

(7)  Citigroup’s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in 

AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately 
described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.

     73                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the second quarter of 2023, Citi’s Russia-related 

exposures increased by $0.5 billion, as shown in the table 
above. The increase in exposure was driven by $1.7 billion of 
dividends that Citi received as custodian for investor clients in 
Russia and is unable to remit due to Russian regulatory 
restrictions (trapped dividends), partially offset by deposit 
outflows as well as a $0.6 billion depreciation of the ruble 
against the U.S. dollar. A portion ($1 billion, net of ruble 
depreciation) of these dividends were placed in reverse 
repurchase agreements. Roughly 65% of Citi’s remaining 
Russia exposures are the trapped dividends discussed above.

Citi’s continued risk mitigation efforts have included ICG 

borrower paydowns and limiting extensions of new credit. 

Citi’s net investment in Russia was approximately $1.1 
billion as of June 30, 2023 (compared to $1.2 billion at March 
31, 2023). Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX exposure in 
AOCI through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing 
mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in 
AOCI. When the ruble depreciates against the USD, the USD 
equivalent value of Citigroup’s investment in AO Citibank 
also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in 
value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going 
forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-
denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a 
change in the fair value of derivative positions used to 
economically hedge the exposures. 

Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses
Citi’s ICG, PBWM and Legacy Franchises segments and 
Corporate/Other have been impacted by various 
macroeconomic factors and volatilities, including Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and its direct and indirect impact on the 
European and global economies. For a broader discussion of 
these factors and volatilities on Citi’s businesses, see 
“Executive Summary” and each business’s results of 
operations above. 

As of June 30, 2023, Citigroup’s ACL included a $0.2 
billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct and indirect 
Russian counterparties (unchanged from March 31, 2023).

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations
During 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking 
businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In 
connection with this wind-down, Citi currently expects to 
incur approximately $180 million (compared to $210 million 
at March 31, 2023) in total estimated charges ($40 million in 
ICG and $140 million in Legacy Franchises, excluding the 
impact from any portfolio sales), largely driven by 
restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related 
charges. Citi’s previously disclosed referral agreement with a 
Russian bank to settle a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit 
card loans, subject to customer consent, was signed in May 
2023 and is in the execution phase. The outstanding amount 
with Citi is to be settled upon referral and refinancing. As a 
result, the credit card loans will remain held-for-investment 
and are not transferred to held-for-sale. For additional 
information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its 
operations and exposure in Russia, see Note 2 and “Risk 

Factors” and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country 
Risk—Russia” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various 
risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, 
including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from 
retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its 
business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation 
events (for additional information, see “Risk Factors—Other 
Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K). Examples of triggers that 
may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include 
voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to 
actions of relevant governmental authorities, including 
expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete 
control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or 
regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to 
elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior 
management. As of June 30, 2023, Citi continued to 
consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation 
factors were triggered.

In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for 
example, through expropriation of AO Citibank Russia, Citi’s 
foreign entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off 
the net investment of approximately $1.1 billion (compared to 
$1.2 billion as of March 31, 2023), (ii) recognize a CTA loss 
of approximately $1.6 billion (compared to $1.4 billion as of 
March 31, 2023) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of 
$0.4 billion (unchanged from March 31, 2023) on 
intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi 
entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial 
liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be 
required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 
billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net 
investment as circumstances evolve.

Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients
Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by 
various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. 
Citi’s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi 
acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest 
and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making 
payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., 
Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The 
international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make 
payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/
dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable 
bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally 
does not have information about the identity of the 
bondholders. As a result of sanctions or other governmental 
requirements and prohibitions, Citi may be exposed to risks 
due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing 
payments on behalf of its clients. To mitigate operational and 
sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, procedures and 
controls for client relationships and payment processing to 
help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and other 
jurisdictions’ sanctions laws.

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the 

processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond 
issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to 

     74                                                                                                                                                                                                            

impact on Citi’s operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, 
as well as the war’s broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and 
reputational impacts. In addition to receiving regular briefings 
from management, the full Board has routinely been invited to 
attend portions of the RMC meetings for discussions related to 
the war in Ukraine, including with respect to Citi’s risk 
exposures and stress testing. The reports to the Board and its 
Committees from senior management who represent the 
impacted businesses and the EMEA region, Independent Risk 
Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk 
Management, including those individuals responsible for 
sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included 
detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on 
capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions 
compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, 
enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise 
their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior 
management has also provided updates to Citi’s Executive 
Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, 
regarding Citi’s Russia-related risks, including with respect to 
cybersecurity matters.

Ukraine
Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war 
through its ICG businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of 
multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the 
public sector. Citi employs approximately 230 people in 
Ukraine and their safety continues to be Citi’s top priority. All 
of Citi’s domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted 
through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian 
hryvnia as its functional currency. Citi’s exposures in Ukraine 
are not significant enough to be included in the “Top 25 
Country Exposures” table above. As of June 30, 2023, Citi had 
$1.3 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine, compared 
to $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2023. The increase in 
exposures reflected a $0.1 billion increase in deposits.

accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose 
to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both 
instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or 
block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the 
payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.

Reputational Risks
Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its 
reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, 
regulators and the public. Citi’s response to the war in 
Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative 
impact on Citi’s reputation with some or all of these parties.
For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a 
result of its current presence in Russia and association with 
Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or 
not, including Citi’s inability to support its global clients in 
Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client 
relationships and businesses; current involvement in 
transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets 
or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and 
regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived 
misalignment of Citi’s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; 
and the reputational impact from Citi’s activity and 
engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting 
their Russia businesses. Citi has considered the potential for 
reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks. Citi 
established a Russia Special Review Process with 
management’s Reputation Risk Committee with oversight for 
significant Russia-related reputation risks and completed a 
number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a Russian 
nexus.

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its 
businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those 
operations during the wind-down process and will be required 
to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining 
legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions 
compliance are highly complex and may change over time and 
result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply 
with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where 
they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, 
conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-
owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and 
will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the 
previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities 
in the country, cessation of new business and client 
originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi’s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in 

Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks 
that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and 
customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs 
and adversely affect its business operations and results of 
operations. For additional information on operational and 
cyber risks, see “Risk Factors—Operational Risk” in Citi’s 
2022 Form 10-K.
Board’s Role in Overseeing Related Risks
The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board’s Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees 
have received and continue to receive regular reports from 
senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its 

     75                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Citi may economically hedge the foreign currency risk in 

its net ARS-denominated assets to the extent possible and 
prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative 
instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. 
As of June 30, 2023, the international NDF market had very 
limited liquidity, resulting in Citi’s inability to economically 
hedge substantially all of its ARS exposure. Accordingly, and 
to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF contracts for this 
unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would record 
devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in earnings, 
without any benefit from a change in the fair value of 
derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure. 
Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its 
Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit 
risk and records mark-to-market adjustments for relevant 
market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes 
it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, 
and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks 
under U.S. GAAP as of June 30, 2023. However, Citi may 
need to record additional reserves in the future, resulting in 
higher ICG cost of credit, should there be an increase in 
transfer risk associated with its Argentine exposures. For 
additional information on Citi’s emerging markets risks, 
including those related to its Argentine exposures, see “Risk 
Factors—Strategic Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Argentina
Citi operates in Argentina through its ICG businesses. As of 
June 30, 2023, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine 
operations was approximately $1.9 billion (compared to $1.8 
billion at March 31, 2023). Under U.S. GAAP, Citi uses the 
U.S. dollar as the functional currency for its operations in 
countries such as Argentina that are deemed highly 
inflationary. Citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate 
fluctuations on its net Argentine peso (ARS)–denominated 
assets directly in earnings. Accordingly, Citi seeks to reduce 
its overall ARS exposure in Argentina while complying with 
local capital and currency exposure limitations. As of June 30, 
2023, Citi’s net ARS exposure was approximately $1.6 billion, 
which decreased from the prior quarter as a result of Citi 
purchasing approximately $300 million of certain local 
government bonds during the second quarter that are indexed 
to the higher of the U.S. dollar exchange rate or the local 
inflation index. Such bonds may reduce the impact to Citi of a 
potential currency devaluation in the future, although it 
remains unclear how effective Citi’s strategies to reduce its 
ARS exposure may be.

As previously disclosed, the Central Bank of Argentina 
has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls 
that generally restrict Citi’s ability to access U.S. dollars in 
Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. 
As a result, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations is 
likely to continue to increase as Citi generates net income in 
its Argentine franchise and its earnings cannot be remitted. 
Due to the currency controls implemented by the Central Bank 
of Argentina, certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms 
have developed that some Argentine entities may use to obtain 
U.S. dollars, generally at rates that are significantly higher 
than Argentina’s official exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is 
precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms, and 
these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure 
Citi’s net monetary assets into the U.S. dollar under U.S. 
GAAP. Citibank Argentina therefore uses Argentina’s official 
market exchange rate to remeasure its net ARS assets into the 
U.S. dollar, which was 256.7 ARS to 1 U.S. dollar as of June 
30, 2023. However, if Argentina’s official exchange rate 
converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect 
foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur a significant 
loss on its capital in Argentina. Current macroeconomic 
conditions in the country, along with sustained high inflation 
and low international reserves held by the Central Bank of 
Argentina, may result in an accelerated or steep depreciation 
of the official exchange rate in the near term. Citi cannot 
predict future fluctuations in Argentina’s official market 
exchange rate or to what extent Citi may be able to access U.S. 
dollars at the official exchange rate in the future. 

     76                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating 

to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation 
models, the significance of inputs or value drivers to the 
valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and 
subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair 
value of these instruments is reported on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in 
either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in AOCI.

Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values 
are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the 
security or could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the 
security prior to recovery, are recognized in earnings. Where 
Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likely-
than-not be required to sell the security, any portion of the loss 
that is attributable to credit is recognized as an allowance for 
credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses 
and the remainder of the loss is recognized in AOCI. Such 
losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and 
amortized cost of the security.

For equity securities carried at cost or under the 
measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the 
carrying value are recognized as impairment in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain 
equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only 
recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income if such decreases are judged to be an other-than-
temporary impairment (OTTI). Assessing if the fair value 
impairment is temporary is also inherently judgmental.

The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the 

effects of Citi’s own credit risk and the market view of 
counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also 
complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi’s 
fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 22 and 23 in this Form 10-Q 
and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 
2022 Form 10-K.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND 
SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES

This section contains a summary of Citi’s most significant 
accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K contains a summary of 
all of Citigroup’s significant accounting policies. These 
policies, as well as estimates made by management, are 
integral to the presentation of Citi’s results of operations and 
financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain 
level of management judgment and estimates, this section 
highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies 
that require management to make highly difficult, complex or 
subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters 
that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see 
also “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 
10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant 
accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments 
with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.

Valuations of Financial Instruments
Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, 
retained interests in securitizations, investments in private 
equity and other financial instruments. A substantial portion of 
these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as Trading account assets, 
Available-for-sale securities and Trading account liabilities.
Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell 
(reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under 
agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of 
which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-
term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as 
certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are 
collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup 
holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale 
and repurchase agreements on Citi’s Consolidated Balance 
Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, 
interest rate risks and private equity investing.

When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices 
to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 
1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, 
Fair Value Measurement. If quoted market prices are not 
available, fair value is based on internally developed valuation 
models that use, where possible, current market-based or 
independently sourced market parameters, such as interest 
rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are 
often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, 
items valued using such internally generated valuation 
techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or 
value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item 
may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 
even though there may be some significant inputs that are 
readily observable.

Citi’s reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans 

and for unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of 
credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Allowance for credit losses 
on loans (ACLL) and Other liabilities (for Allowance for 
credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), 
respectively. In addition, Citi’s reserves for expected credit 
losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, 
including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase 
agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and 
other financial receivables are reflected in Other assets. These 
reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to 
as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as Provision for 
credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each 
reporting period. Citi’s ability to estimate expected credit 
losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&S) period is 
based on the ability to forecast economic activity over an R&S 
timeframe. The R&S forecast period for consumer and 
corporate credit exposures is eight quarters.

The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative 

management adjustment components. The quantitative 
component uses three forward-looking macroeconomic 
forecast scenarios—base, upside and downside. The 

qualitative management adjustment component reflects risks 
and current economic conditions not fully captured in the 
quantitative component. Both the quantitative and qualitative 
components are further discussed below.

Quantitative Component
Citi estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative 
component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss 
and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) 
external credit bureau and rating agencies information and (iv) 
R&S forecasts of macroeconomic conditions.

For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi’s expected 
credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that 
consider the borrowers’ probability of default (PD), loss given 
default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss 
likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected 
credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic 
variables, including housing prices, unemployment rate and 
real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, 
product and business segments.

In addition, Citi’s models determine expected credit 
losses based on leading credit indicators, including loan 
delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, 

     78                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit 
trends. 

Qualitative Component
The qualitative management adjustment component includes, 
among other things, risks that are not fully captured in the 
quantitative component. These may include but are not limited 
to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not 
within historical loss data or the economic forecast, 
uncertainty in the environment and other factors as required by 
banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary 
examples of these are:

•

•

•

Expected normalization of portfolio performance and 
consumer behavior from recent low losses as a result of 
government stimulus and market liquidity during the 
COVID-19 pandemic
Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due 
to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, 
including those related to potential global recession, 
inflation, interest rates, commodity prices and geopolitical 
tensions 
Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. 
for certain safety and soundness considerations under U.S. 
banking law

Citi’s qualitative component of the ACL continued to 
decline quarter-over-quarter. The decline was primarily driven 
by releases of COVID-19–related uncertainty reserves as the 
portfolio continues to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels 
and as these risks are captured in the quantitative component 
of the ACL. These releases were partially offset by a build for 
transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. driven 
by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking 
law.

Macroeconomic Variables
Citi considers a multitude of global macroeconomic variables 
for the base, upside and downside probability-weighted 
macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the ACL. 
Citi’s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real 
GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables 
that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL. 

The tables below present Citi’s forecasted quarterly 
average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real 
GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic 
forecast for Citi’s ACL for each quarterly reporting period 
from 2Q22 to 2Q23:

2023, while the unemployment rate is expected to increase 
modestly over the eight-quarter forecast horizon, broadly 
returning to pre-pandemic levels. 

Scenario Weighting
Citi’s ACL is estimated using three probability-weighted 
macroeconomic scenarios—base, upside and downside. The 
macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a 
statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into 
consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity 
of the scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and 
risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis. 

Citi’s downside scenario incorporates more adverse 
macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For 
example, compared to the base scenario, Citi’s downside 
scenario reflects a more severe recession, including an 
elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% over the 
eight-quarter R&S period, with a peak difference of 3.0% in 
the fourth quarter of 2024. The downside scenario also reflects 
a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2024 of 1.9%, 
with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference to the base 
scenario of 1.0% in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Citi’s ACL is sensitive to the various macroeconomic 

scenarios that drive the quantitative component of expected 
credit losses due to changes in the length and severity of 
forecasted economic variables or events in the respective 
scenarios. To demonstrate this sensitivity, Citi applied 100% 
weight to the downside scenario as of June 30, 2023, to reflect 
the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the multiple 
macroeconomic scenarios. Citi’s downside scenario 
incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than 
the weighted scenario assumptions; therefore, applying a 
100% downside scenario weight would result in a hypothetical 
increase in the ACL of approximately $4.5 billion related to 
lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for 
credit losses.

This analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes 

to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could 
decrease the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on 
historical experience and current conditions at the time of the 
assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic 
forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate 
based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic 
scenario approach combined with the qualitative component 
remains appropriate as of June 30, 2023.

See Notes 1 and 14 for a further description of the ACL 

and related accounts.

Goodwill
Citi tests goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1 
(the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the 
annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that 
would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting 
unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances 
include, among other things, a significant adverse change in 
the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a 
significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease 
in Citi’s stock price.

At October 1, 2022, the fair value of two reporting units 
(Banking and Mexico Consumer/SBMM) ranged from 102% 
to 106% of their carrying values. The carrying values of the 
Banking and Mexico Consumer/SBMM reporting units 
included approximately $1.5 billion and $1 billion of 
goodwill, respectively. For each of the remaining reporting 
units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10%.

While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded 
in the key assumptions used in the valuations of the reporting 
units, the economic and business environments continue to 
evolve as Citi’s management implements its strategic refresh. 
If management’s future estimates of key economic and market 
assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi 
could potentially experience material goodwill impairment 
charges in the future. See Note 15 for a further discussion of 
goodwill.

Litigation Accruals
See the discussion in Note 26 for information regarding Citi’s 
policies on establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory 
contingencies.

2Q23 Changes in the ACL
As further discussed below, Citi’s ending ACL balance for the 
second quarter of 2023 was $20.1 billion, compared to $19.8 
billion as of March 31, 2023. The net build of $0.3 billion was 
primarily driven by growth in card balances in PBWM, 
partially offset by a release in the corporate portfolios due to 
an improved macroeconomic outlook. Based on its latest 
macroeconomic forecast, Citi believes its analysis of the ACL 
reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of 
June 30, 2023. See Note 14 for additional information.

Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
Citi’s consumer ACLL is largely driven by U.S. cards 
(Branded cards and Retail services) in U.S. Personal Banking. 
Citi’s total consumer ACLL build was $0.4 billion in the 
second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by growth in U.S. 
cards balances, resulting in a June 30, 2023 ACLL balance of 
$14.9 billion, or 3.97% of total funded consumer loans. 
For U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total 

funded loans decreased to 7.86% at June 30, 2023, due to 
volume growth in lower-loss portfolios, compared to 8.08% at 
March 31, 2023. For the remaining consumer exposures, the 
level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.28% at 
June 30, 2023, compared to 1.21% at March 31, 2023.

Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
Citi had a corporate ACLL release of $0.2 billion in the 
second quarter of 2023. The release was primarily driven by 
an improved macroeconomic outlook. The ACLL reserve 
balance decreased by $0.2 billion to $2.6 billion, or 0.94% of 
total funded corporate loans. 

ACLUC
Citi had an ACLUC release of $0.1 billion in the second 
quarter of 2023, which reduced the ACLUC reserve balance, 
included in Other liabilities, to $1.9 billion. The release was 
primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook.

ACL on Other Financial Assets
Citi’s ending ACL balance on other financial assets carried at 
amortized cost for the second quarter of 2023 was $0.8 billion, 
compared to $0.6 billion as of March 31, 2023. The net build 
of $0.1 billion was primarily driven by a reserve build of $0.3 
billion related to an increase in transfer risk associated with 
exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness 
considerations under U.S. banking law, partially offset by the 
reserve release related to the repayment of the First Republic 
Bank deposit. See Note 14 for additional information.

Regulatory Capital Impact
Citi elected the modified CECL transition provision for 
regulatory capital purposes provided by the U.S. banking 
agencies’ final rule. Accordingly, the Day One regulatory 
capital effects resulting from the adoption of CECL, as well as 
the ongoing adjustments for 25% of the change in CECL-
based allowances in each quarter between January 1, 2020 and 
December 31, 2021, started to be phased in on January 1, 2022 
and will be fully reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital as of 
January 1, 2025. 

     80

Citi’s effective tax rate was 27% in the second quarter of 
2023, including the impact of divestitures, versus 20% in the 
second quarter of 2022, largely driven by the geographic mix 
of earnings. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, Citi’s 
effective tax rate increased to 26%, including the impact of 
divestitures, compared to 19% in the prior-year period, largely 
driven by lower discrete benefits. 

Deferred Tax Assets 
For additional information on Citi’s deferred tax assets 
(DTAs), see “Capital Resources,” “Risk Factors—Strategic 
Risks,” “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates—Income Taxes” and Notes 1 and 9 to the

At June 30, 2023, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of 

approximately $28.5 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion from 
March 31, 2023 and $0.8 billion from December 31, 2022. 
The increase for the second quarter and year to date was 
primarily a result of Citi’s geographic mix of earnings. Of 
Citi’s $28.5 billion of net DTAs, $16.8 billion was not 
deducted in calculating regulatory capital and was 
appropriately risk weighted under the Basel III rules. The 
remaining $11.7 billion (compared to $11.1 billion at 
March 31, 2023) was deducted in calculating Citi’s regulatory 
capital. 

The $11.7 billion of DTA deducted from regulatory 

capital was composed of $11.5 billion related to tax carry-
forwards and $1.8 billion of temporary differences in excess of 
the 10%/15% regulatory limitations, reduced by $1.6 billion of 
deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and 
certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted 
from capital. The largest component of the increase in the 
DTA deducted from Citi’s regulatory capital during the 
quarter was related to temporary differences in excess of the 
10%/15% limitations ($1.8 billion at June 30, 2023 compared 
to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2023), primarily attributable to 
higher temporary differences in DTAs subject to the 
limitation.

DTA Realizability
Citi believes that realization of the net DTAs of $28.5 billion 
at June 30, 2023 is more-likely-than-not, based on 
management’s expectations of future taxable income 
generation in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as 
well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as 
defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes).

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND 
PROCEDURES

Citi’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to 
ensure that information required to be disclosed under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, 
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including without 
limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in 
its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to 
management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for 
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Citi’s Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in 

their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and 
evaluate the effectiveness of Citi’s disclosure controls and 
procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, 
among other things, the oversight, maintenance and 
implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, 
subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.
Citi’s management, with the participation of its CEO and 
CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup’s disclosure 
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of June 30, 2023. 
Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded 
that at that date Citigroup’s disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective.

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 
OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND 
SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria 
Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added 
Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly 
reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates 
knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or 
dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities 
that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure is 
generally required even where the activities, transactions or 
dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. 
To the extent that transactions or dealings for its clients are 
permitted by U.S. law, Citi may continue to engage in such 
activities.

Citi, in its First Quarter of 2023 Form 10-Q, identified 
and reported certain activities pursuant to Section 219 for the 
fourth quarter of 2022. During the second quarter of 2023, 
Citigroup identified eight transactions pursuant to Section 219:

•

•

Between April 20, 2023 and April 24, 2023, Citibank 
(Hong Kong) Limited (CHKL) processed seven 
transactions involving the account of a Specially 
Designated National, who was designated on April 19, 
2023, pursuant to the Weapons of Mass Destruction 
Proliferators Sanctions Regulations. The total value of the 
seven transactions was approximately USD 605,029.05, 
which includes a nominal fee that CHKL realized in 
relation to a transaction that was ultimately blocked; 
CHKL did not realize any additional fees. Once 
identified, the transactions were disclosed to the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets 
Control (OFAC).
On June 7, 2023, CHKL and Citibank, N.A., New York 
Branch, processed a transaction from a Specially 
Designated National, who was designated on June 6, 
2023, pursuant to the Weapons of Mass Destruction 
Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, to a non-sanctioned 
entity in China. The total value of the transaction was 
USD 4,736.18 and CHKL did not realize any fees for the 
processing of the transaction. Once identified, the 
transaction was disclosed to OFAC. 

     82                                                                                                                                                                                                            

   
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain statements in this Form 10-Q, including but not 
limited to statements included within the Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations, are “forward-looking statements” within the 
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995. In addition, Citigroup may make forward-looking 
statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the 
SEC, and its management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others.

Generally, forward-looking statements are not based on 

historical facts but instead represent Citigroup’s and its 
management’s beliefs regarding future events. Such 
statements may be identified by words such as believe, expect, 
anticipate, intend, estimate, may increase, may fluctuate, target 
and illustrative, and similar expressions or future or 
conditional verbs such as will, should, would and could.
Such statements are based on management’s current 
expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes 
in circumstances. Actual results of operations and financial 
conditions, including capital and liquidity, may differ 
materially from those included in these statements due to a 
variety of factors, including without limitation (i) the 
precautionary statements included within the “Executive 
Summary” and each business’s discussion and analysis of its 
results of operations above, in Citi’s First Quarter of 2023 
Form 10-Q, in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K and in Citi’s other SEC 
filings; (ii) the factors listed and described under “Risk 
Factors” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K; and (iii) the risks and 
uncertainties summarized below:

•

•

the potential impact to Citi from continued 
macroeconomic, geopolitical and other challenges, 
uncertainties and volatility, including, among others, 
governmental fiscal and monetary actions or expected 
actions, including further increases in interest rates, 
reductions in central bank balance sheets, or other 
changes in interest rate or other monetary policies; 
potential recessions in the U.S., Europe and other regions 
and countries; a potential U.S. federal government 
shutdown and the resulting impacts; elevated levels of 
inflation and their impacts; economic and geopolitical 
challenges related to China, including weak economic 
growth and tensions related to Taiwan; other geopolitical 
challenges, tensions and conflicts, including those related 
to Russia’s war in Ukraine; impacts related to recent bank 
failures and related market volatility, including 
macroeconomic conditions; foreign currency volatility 
and devaluations; distress and volatility in emerging 
markets, including sovereign debt pricing; protracted or 
widespread trade tensions; and election outcomes;
the potential impact on Citi’s ability to return capital to 
common shareholders consistent with its capital planning 
efforts and targets, due to, among other things: changes in 
regulatory capital rules, requirements or interpretations, 
such as revisions to the U.S. Basel III rules, including the 
recently issued notice of proposed rulemaking, known as 
the Basel III Endgame, related to regulatory capital 

requirements; regulatory capital requirements, including 
annual recalibration of the Stress Capital Buffer 
(preliminarily increased effective as of October 1, 2023); 
recalibration of the GSIB surcharge; Citi’s results of 
operations and financial condition; the capital impacts 
related to Citi’s remaining consumer banking divestitures, 
and achievement of the expected benefits from the 
divestitures; Citi’s effectiveness in planning, managing 
and calculating its level of risk-weighted assets under 
both the Advanced Approaches and the Standardized 
Approach and Supplementary Leverage ratio and GSIB 
surcharge; Citi’s implementation and maintenance of an 
effective capital planning framework; forecasts of 
macroeconomic conditions; and Citi’s DTA utilization;
the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and 
changes faced by financial institutions, including Citi, in 
the U.S. and globally, such as potential fiscal, monetary, 
regulatory, tax, sanctions and other changes, including 
potential increased regulatory requirements and costs such 
as the imposition of additional or special assessments by 
the FDIC, including the recently issued notice of proposed 
rulemaking to recover the uninsured deposit losses from 
recent bank failures; potential changes to various aspects 
of the regulatory capital framework; future legislative and 
regulatory requirements in the U.S. and globally relating 
to sustainability and climate change, including any new 
disclosure requirements, such as those proposed and/or 
adopted by the SEC and the EU; increased legislative 
activity by U.S. states that restricts the flow of capital and 
investment by financial institutions to state governmental 
entities, including anti-ESG initiatives that are designed to 
push back against corporate ESG policies; and the 
potential impact these uncertainties and changes could 
have on Citi’s businesses, results of operations, financial 
condition, business planning and compliance risks and 
costs;
the potential impact to credit card fee revenues in Branded 
cards and Retail services in PBWM from the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau’s proposed significant 
changes to the maximum amounts on credit card late fees;
Citi’s ability to improve its risk and controls environment, 
modernize its data and technology infrastructure and 
further enhance safety and soundness, meet regulatory 
expectations, be sufficiently competitive, serve clients 
effectively, avoid operational errors and realize 
productivity improvements, as part of its transformation 
and other strategic initiatives, including as a result of 
factors that Citi cannot control, which could make the 
initiatives more costly and more challenging to 
implement, and limit their effectiveness;
Citi’s ability to achieve its objectives from its strategic 
refresh, including, among others, those related to its exits 
of remaining consumer banking businesses in Legacy 
Franchises, including, among others, the consumer, small 
business and middle-market operations in Mexico, and 
Citi’s wind-down of its activities in Russia, Korea and 
China, which involve significant execution complexity, 
may not be as productive, effective or timely as Citi 
expects, may impact the local businesses during the exit

process, and could result in losses, charges or other 
negative financial or strategic impacts, which could be 
material; 
the potential impact to Citi from climate change and the 
transition to a low-carbon economy, including both 
physical risks, such as increased frequency and/or severity 
of adverse weather events as consequences of chronic 
climate changes, and transition risks, such as those arising 
from changes in regulations or market preferences toward 
a low-carbon economy; higher regulatory, compliance, 
credit, reputational and other risks and costs and data-
related challenges, including as a result of any new 
disclosure requirements; and an increased focus by 
banking regulators and others on the issue of climate 
change at financial institutions directly and with respect to 
their clients;
Citi’s ability to utilize its DTAs (including the foreign tax 
credit component of its DTAs) and thus reduce the 
negative impact of the DTAs on Citi’s regulatory capital, 
including as a result of its ability to generate U.S. taxable 
income in the relevant tax carry-forward periods;
the potential impact to Citi if its interpretation or 
application of the complex income-based and non-
income-based (such as withholding, stamp, service and 
other non-income taxes) tax laws to which it is subject in 
the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions differs from those 
of the relevant governmental taxing authorities, including 
as a result of litigation or examinations regarding non-
income-based tax matters, and the resulting payment of 
additional taxes, penalties or interest;
the potential impact from a deterioration in or failure to 
maintain Citi’s co-branding or private label credit card 
relationships, due to, among other things, the general 
economic environment; changes in consumer sentiment, 
spending patterns and credit card usage behaviors; a 
decline in sales and revenues, partner store closures or 
other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant; 
early termination of a particular relationship; or other 
factors, including bankruptcies, liquidations, 
restructurings, consolidations or other similar events, 
whether due to the impact of a challenging economic 
environment or otherwise;
Citi’s ability in its resolution plan submissions to address 
any shortcomings or deficiencies or guidance provided by 
the Federal Reserve Board or FDIC;
the potential impact on Citi’s performance and the 
performance of its individual businesses, including its 
competitive position and ability to effectively manage its 
businesses, and its ability to effectively execute its 
transformation and other strategic initiatives, if Citi is 
unable to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified 
employees, particularly given the highly competitive 
environment for talent and other factors, such as low 
unemployment, changes in worker’s expectations and 
regulation of employee compensation in the banking 
industry;
Citi’s ability to compete effectively in the U.S. and 
globally with both financial and non-financial services 
firms, including as a result of certain competitors being 
subject to less stringent legal and regulatory requirements; 

the introduction of new or emerging technologies and 
mobile platforms; possible disruptions from artificial 
intelligence-driven solutions; growth in digital asset 
markets; changes in the payments space; reliance on third 
parties for certain product and service offerings and 
impact if any third party is unable to provide adequate 
support for such product and service offerings; and the 
increased operational, compliance and other risks 
resulting from the need to develop new or change or adapt 
existing products and services to attract and retain 
customers or clients or to compete more effectively with 
competitors;
the potential impact to Citi from a prior or future failure 
or disruption of its operational processes or systems, 
including as a result of, among other things, human error, 
such as manual transaction processing errors (e.g., 
erroneous payments to lenders or manual errors by Citi 
traders that cause system and market disruptions and 
losses for Citi or its clients), which can be exacerbated by 
staffing challenges and processing backlogs; fraud or 
malice on the part of employees or third parties; 
operational or execution failures or deficiencies by third 
parties; insufficient (or limited) straight-through 
processing between legacy systems and any failure to 
design and effectively operate controls that mitigate 
operational risks associated with those legacy systems, 
leading to potential risk of errors and operating losses; 
accidental system or technological failure; electrical or 
telecommunication outages; failure of or cyber incidents 
involving computer servers or infrastructure; other similar 
losses or damage to Citi’s property or assets; failures by 
third parties; potential disruptions and/or malfunctions 
within Citi’s businesses, as well as the operations of Citi’s 
clients, customers or other third parties; and the increased 
financial, reputational, legal and compliance risks 
resulting from any such failure or disruption of 
operational processes or systems, including legal and 
regulatory actions or proceedings, fines and other costs;
the increasing risk to Citi’s and third parties’ computer 
systems and networks from continually evolving, 
sophisticated cybersecurity incidents that could result in, 
among other things, theft, loss, misuse or disclosure of 
confidential Citi, client or customer information or assets 
and a disruption of computer, software or network 
systems; and the potential impact from such risks, 
including reputational damage, regulatory penalties, loss 
of revenues, additional costs (including repair, 
remediation and other costs), exposure to litigation and 
other financial losses;
the potential impact of changes or errors in accounting 
assumptions, judgments or estimates, or the application of 
certain accounting principles, related to the preparation of 
Citi’s financial statements, including the estimate of Citi’s 
ACL, which depends on its CECL models and 
assumptions, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and 
characteristics of Citi’s loan portfolios and other 
applicable financial assets; reserves related to litigation,

the financial impact from reclassification of any CTA 
component of AOCI, including related hedges and taxes, 
into Citi’s earnings, due to a sale, IPO, substantial 
liquidation or other deconsolidation event of any foreign 
operations, such as those related to Citi’s remaining 
consumer banking divestitures or other legacy businesses, 
whether due to Citi’s strategic refresh or otherwise;
the impact of changes to financial accounting and 
reporting standards or interpretations of how Citi records 
and reports its financial condition and results of 
operations;
the potential impact to Citi’s results of operations and/or 
regulatory capital and capital ratios if Citi’s risk 
management and mitigation processes, strategies or 
models, including those related to its comprehensive 
stress testing initiatives or ability to manage, assess and 
aggregate data, are deficient or ineffective, or Citi’s Basel 
III regulatory capital models require refinement, 
modification or enhancement, or any related action is 
taken by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators;
the potential impact of credit risk and concentrations of 
risk on Citi’s results of operations, whether due to a 
default of or deterioration involving consumer, corporate 
or public sector borrowers or other counterparties in the 
U.S. or in various countries and jurisdictions globally, 
including from indemnification obligations in connection 
with various transactions, such as hedging or reinsurance 
arrangements related to those obligations, or Citi’s 
inability to liquidate or realize the fair value of its 
collateral, which risks can be heightened for vulnerable 
industries or sectors impacted by the continued 
macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other challenges 
and uncertainties and volatilities;
the potential impact on Citi’s liquidity and/or costs of 
funding if it does not effectively manage its liquidity or 
due to various other factors, including, among others, 
general disruptions in the financial markets; deposit 
outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix, whether 
driven by migration to higher-yielding products or 
otherwise; governmental fiscal and monetary policies; 
regulatory changes; negative investor perceptions of Citi’s 
creditworthiness; competition for funding, including a 
decrease in demand for corporate debt, unexpected 
increases in cash or collateral requirements, and the 
consequent inability to monetize available liquidity 
resources; changes in Citi’s credit spreads; higher interest 
rates; and changes in currency exchange rates;
the impact of a credit ratings downgrade of Citi or certain 
of its subsidiaries or issuing entities on Citi’s funding and 
liquidity as well as on the operations of certain of its 
businesses;
the potential impact to Citi of ongoing interpretation and 
implementation of regulatory and legislative requirements 
and changes in the U.S. and globally, as well as 
heightened regulatory scrutiny and expectations for large 
financial institutions and their employees and agents, with 
respect to governance, infrastructure, data, climate and 
risk management practices and controls, customer and 
client protection, market practices, anti-money laundering 
and increasingly complex sanctions and disclosure

regimes, including the impact on Citi’s compliance, 
regulatory and other risks and costs, such as increased 
regulatory oversight and restrictions, enforcement 
proceedings, penalties and fines;
the potential outcomes of the extensive legal and 
regulatory proceedings, examinations, investigations, 
consent orders and related compliance efforts and other 
inquiries, to which Citi is or may be subject at any given 
time, such as the previously disclosed October 2020 FRB 
and OCC consent orders, particularly given the increased 
focus by regulators on risk and controls, such as 
enterprise-wide risk management, compliance, data 
quality management and governance and internal controls, 
and policies and procedures; Citi’s ability to implement 
targeted actions plans and submit quarterly progress 
reports detailing the results and status of improvements to 
comply with the consent orders on a timely and sufficient 
basis, which will continue to require significant 
investments to meet regulatory expectations; the 
heightened scrutiny and expectations generally from 
regulators, and the severity of the remedies sought by 
regulators, such as significant monetary penalties, 
supervisory or enforcement orders, business restrictions, 
limitations on dividends, changes to directors and/or 
officers and collateral consequences to Citi arising from 
such outcomes; and
the various risks faced by Citi as a result of its presence in 
the emerging markets, including, among others, 
limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign 
investments; foreign currency volatility and devaluations; 
sustained elevated interest rates; sovereign debt volatility; 
election outcomes; regulatory changes and political 
events; foreign exchange controls, including the inability 
to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms; 
macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges and 
uncertainties and volatility, including with respect to 
commodity prices as well as repricing of assets and 
resulting impacts; limitations on foreign investment; 
sociopolitical instability (including from hyperinflation); 
fraud; nationalization or loss of licenses; business 
restrictions; sanctions or asset freezes; potential criminal 
charges; closure of branches or subsidiaries; confiscation 
of assets, whether related to geopolitical conflicts or 
otherwise; the need to record additional reserves based on 
the transfer risk associated with exposures outside the 
U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations under 
U.S. banking law; and increased compliance and 
regulatory risks and costs.

(3)  Consistent with the revisions disclosed in “Statement of Cash Flows” in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K, during the six 
months ended June 30, 2022, $16.1 billion of cash flows related to maturities of short-term negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) and $41 million of cash flows 
related to purchases of short-term NCDs were reclassified from purchases and maturities of AFS securities within investing activities to Other, net within 
operating activities.
In January 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-01. Upon adoption, Citi transferred $3.3 billion of mortgage-backed securities from HTM classification to AFS 
classification as allowed under the ASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of $0.1 billion, which was recorded in AOCI 
upon transfer. See Note 1.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION, UPDATED 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING 
CHANGES 

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial 
Statements as of June 30, 2023 and for the three- and six-
month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 include the 
accounts of Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting 

of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair 
presentation have been reflected. The accompanying 
unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in 
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
related notes included within Citigroup’s Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 
10-K) and Citigroup’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the 
quarter ended March 31, 2023 (First Quarter of 2023 Form 10-
Q).

Certain financial information that is normally included in 
annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but is not 
required for interim reporting purposes, has been condensed or 
omitted.

Management must make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related 
footnote disclosures. While management uses its best 
judgment, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

As noted above, the Notes to these Consolidated Financial 

Statements are unaudited. 

Throughout these Notes, “Citigroup,” “Citi” and “the 

Company” refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated 
subsidiaries.

Certain reclassifications and updates have been made to 

the prior periods’ financial statements and notes to conform to 
the current period’s presentation.

Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in 

Cash and due from banks and predominately all of Deposits 
with banks. Cash flows from risk management activities are 
classified in the same category as the related assets and 
liabilities. Amounts included in Cash and due from banks and 
Deposits with banks approximate fair value.

UPDATED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies below have been updated from those 
disclosed in Citi’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2022 
Form 10-K) as a result of accounting standards adopted during 
the first quarter of 2023. 

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K for a summary of all of Citigroup’s 
significant accounting policies.

Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)
Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi adopted Accounting 
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments
—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings 
and Vintage Disclosures under the methodology described 
below. For information about Citi’s accounting for troubled 
debt restructurings (TDRs) prior to January 1, 2023, see Note 
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

TDRs and Vintage Disclosures
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial 
Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt 
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. Citi adopted the ASU 
on January 1, 2023. Citi adopted the guidance on the 
recognition and measurement of TDRs under the modified 
retrospective approach. 

Adopting these amendments resulted in a decrease to the 
ACLL of $352 million and an increase in other assets related 
to held-for-sale businesses of $44 million, with a 
corresponding increase to retained earnings of $290 million 
and a decrease in deferred tax assets of $106 million on 
January 1, 2023. The ACL for corporate loans was unaffected 
because the measurement approach used for corporate loans is 
not in the scope of this ASU. 

ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and disclosure 
requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure 
the ACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) 
approach. With the elimination of TDR accounting 
requirements, reasonably expected TDRs are no longer 
considered when determining the term over which to estimate 
expected credit losses. The ACLL for modified loans that are 
collateral dependent continues to be based on the fair value of 
the collateral.

Consumer Loans
Upon adoption of the ASU on January 1, 2023, Citi 
discontinued the use of a DCF approach for consumer loans 
formerly considered TDRs. Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi 
measures the ACLL for all consumer loans under approaches 
that do not incorporate discounting, primarily utilizing models 
that consider the borrowers’ probability of default, loss given 
default and exposure at default. In addition, upon adoption of 
the ASU, Citi collectively evaluates smaller-balance 
homogenous loans formerly considered TDRs for expected 

     95                                                                                                                                                                                                            

credit losses, whereas previously those loans had been 
individually evaluated.

The ASU also requires disclosure of modifications of 
loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty if the 
modification involves principal forgiveness, an interest rate 
reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term 
extension or a combination of those types of modifications. In 
addition, the ASU requires the disclosure of current-period 
gross write-offs by year of loan origination (vintage). The 
amendments related to disclosures are required to be applied 
prospectively beginning as of the date of adoption. See Note 
13 for these new disclosures for periods beginning on and 
after January 1, 2023.

Long-Duration Insurance Contracts
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, 
Financial Services—Insurance: Targeted Improvements to the 
Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, which changes the 
existing recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosures for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance 
entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves the timeliness of 
recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits 
and prescribes the rate used to discount future cash flows for 
long-duration insurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves 
the accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees 
associated with deposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) 
simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and 
(iv) introduces additional quantitative and qualitative 
disclosures. Citi has certain insurance subsidiaries, primarily 
in Mexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts such as 
traditional life insurance policies and life-contingent annuity 
contracts that are impacted by the requirements of ASU 
2018-12.

Citi adopted the targeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 

on January 1, 2023, resulting in a $39 million decrease in 
Other liabilities and a $27 million increase in AOCI, after-tax. 

FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, 
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): 
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the 
Proportional Amortization Method. The ASU expands the 
scope of tax equity investments eligible to apply the 
proportional amortization method of accounting. Under the 
proportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible 
investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits 
and other income tax benefits that are received by the investor, 
with the amortization of the investment and the income tax 
credits being presented net in the income statement as 
components of income tax expense (benefit). Prior to the 
issuance of this ASU, use of the proportional amortization 
method was limited to tax equity investments in Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) structures, and all other tax 
equity investments were typically accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting, which resulted in investment 
income, gains and losses, and tax credits being presented gross 
on the income statement in their respective line items. The 
ASU will permit the Company to elect to use the proportional 
amortization method to account for all eligible tax equity 
investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which 
the income tax credits are received, if certain conditions are 
met. For public entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 2023, although early adoption is 
permitted in any interim period. However, if an entity adopts 
the amendments in an interim period, it shall adopt them as of 
the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim 
period. Adoption of the ASU must be applied on either a 
retrospective or a modified retrospective basis. Citi plans to 
adopt the ASU on January 1, 2024 and is currently evaluating 
the impact of the standard on tax equity investments. Citi does 
not expect a material impact to its results of operations as a 
result of adopting the standard.

Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to 
Contractual Sale Restrictions
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value 
Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity 
Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The ASU 
was issued to address diversity in practice whereby certain 
entities included the impact of contractual restrictions when 
valuing equity securities, and it clarifies that a contractual 
restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be 
considered part of the unit of account of the equity security 
and, therefore, should not be considered in measuring fair 
value. The ASU also includes requirements for entities to 
disclose the fair value of equity securities subject to 
contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration 
of the restrictions and the circumstances that could cause a 
lapse in the restrictions. 

The ASU is to be adopted on a prospective basis and will 

be effective for Citi on January 1, 2024, although early 
adoption is permitted. Adoption of the accounting standard is 
not expected to have an impact on Citi’s operating results or 
financial position, as the Company does not include such 
restrictions when valuing equity securities.

2.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SIGNIFICANT 
DISPOSALS AND OTHER BUSINESS EXITS

Summary of Discontinued Operations
The Company’s results from Discontinued operations 
consisted of residual activities related to the sales of the Egg 
Banking plc credit card business in 2011 and the German retail 
banking business in 2008. All Discontinued operations results 
are recorded within Corporate/Other.

During the second quarter of 2022, the Company finalized 

the settlement of certain liabilities related to its legacy 
consumer operation in the U.K. (the legacy operation), 
including an indemnification liability related to its sale of the 
Egg Banking business in 2011, which led to the substantial 
liquidation of the legacy operation. As a result, a CTA loss 
(net of hedges) in AOCI of approximately $400 million pretax 
($345 million after-tax) related to the legacy operation was 
released to earnings in the second quarter of 2022. Out of the 
total CTA release, a $260 million pretax loss ($221 million 
after-tax loss) was attributable to the Egg Banking business 
noted above, reported in Discontinued operations, and 
therefore the corresponding CTA release was also reported in 
Discontinued operations during the second quarter of 2022. 
The remaining CTA release of a $140 million pretax loss 
($124 million after-tax loss) related to Legacy Holdings Assets 
was reported as part of Continuing operations within Legacy 
Franchises. 

While the legacy operation was divested in multiple sales 

over the years, each transaction did not result in substantial 
liquidation given that Citi retained certain liabilities noted 
above, which were gradually settled over time until reaching 
the point of substantial liquidation during the second quarter 
of 2022, triggering the release of the CTA loss to earnings.

Cash flows from Discontinued operations were not 

material for the periods presented.

Significant Disposals 
As of June 30, 2023, Citi had entered into sale agreements for nine consumer banking businesses within Legacy Franchises. Australia 
closed in the second quarter of 2022, the Philippines closed in the third quarter of 2022, Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in the 
fourth quarter of 2022, and India and Vietnam closed in the first quarter of 2023. Entry of sale agreements for the Taiwan and 
Indonesia consumer banking businesses has resulted in the reclassification to HFS on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of 
approximately $14 billion in assets within Other assets, including approximately $8 billion of loans (net of allowance of $68 million), 
and approximately $11 billion in liabilities within Other liabilities, including approximately $11 billion in deposits. Of the nine sale 
agreements, the five below were identified as significant disposals as of June 30, 2023. The Taiwan sale has yet to close and is subject 
to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

(1)  Loans, net of allowance as of June 30, 2023 includes $31 million for Taiwan.
(2)  On June 1, 2022, Citi completed the sale of its Australia consumer banking business, which was part of Legacy Franchises. The business had approximately 

$9.4 billion in assets, including $9.3 billion of loans (net of allowance of $140 million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $7.3 billion 
including $6.8 billion in deposits. The transaction generated a pretax loss on sale of approximately $760 million ($640 million after-tax), subject to closing 
adjustments, recorded in Other revenue. The loss on sale primarily reflected the impact of an approximate pretax $620 million CTA loss (net of hedges) 
($470 million after-tax) already reflected in the AOCI component of equity. The sale closed on June 1, 2022, and the CTA-related balance was removed from 
AOCI, resulting in a neutral CTA impact to Citi’s CET1 Capital. The income before taxes shown in the above table for Australia reflects Citi’s ownership through 
June 1, 2022.

(3)  On August 1, 2022, Citi completed the sale of its Philippines consumer banking business, which was part of Legacy Franchises. The business had approximately 

$1.8 billion in assets, including $1.2 billion of loans (net of allowance of $80 million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $1.3 billion, 
including $1.2 billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $618 million ($290 million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, 
recorded in Other revenue. The income before taxes shown in the above table for the Philippines reflects Citi’s ownership through August 1, 2022.

(4)  On November 1, 2022, Citi completed the sale of its Thailand consumer banking business, which was part of Legacy Franchises. The business had approximately 
$2.7 billion in assets, including $2.4 billion of loans (net of allowance of $67 million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $1.0 billion, 
including $0.8 billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $209 million ($115 million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, 
recorded in Other revenue. The income before taxes shown in the above table for Thailand reflects Citi’s ownership through November 1, 2022.

(5)  On March 1, 2023, Citi completed the sale of its India consumer banking business, which was part of Legacy Franchises. The business had approximately 

$5.2 billion in assets, including $3.4 billion of loans (net of allowance of $32 million) and excluding goodwill. The total amount of liabilities was $5.2 billion, 
including $5.1 billion in deposits. The sale resulted in a pretax gain on sale of approximately $1.1 billion ($727 million after-tax), subject to closing adjustments, 
recorded in Other revenue. The income before taxes shown in the above table for India reflects Citi’s ownership through March 1, 2023.

(6)  This sale is expected to result in an after-tax gain upon closing.
(7) 

Income before taxes for the period in which the individually significant component was classified as HFS for all prior periods presented. For Australia, excludes 
the pretax loss on sale. For the Philippines, Thailand and India, excludes the pretax gain on sale.

Citi did not have any other significant disposals as of 
June 30, 2023. As of August 4, 2023, Citi had not entered into 
sale agreements for the remaining Legacy Franchises 
businesses to be sold, specifically the Poland consumer 
banking business and the Mexico Consumer/SBMM 
businesses. 

For a description of the Company’s significant disposal 
transactions in prior periods and financial impact, see Note 2 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 
10-K.

Other Business Exits

Wind-Down of Korea Consumer Banking Business
On October 25, 2021, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down 
and close its Korea consumer banking business, which is 
reported in the Legacy Franchises operating segment. In 
connection with the announcement, Citibank Korea Inc. (CKI) 
commenced a voluntary early termination program (Korea 
VERP). Due to the voluntary nature of this termination 
program, no liabilities for termination benefits are recorded 
until CKI makes formal offers to employees that are then 
irrevocably accepted by those employees. Related charges are 
recorded as Compensation and benefits. 

The following table summarizes the reserve charges 
related to the Korea VERP and other initiatives reported in the 
Legacy Franchises operating segment and Corporate/Other:

The total cash charges for the wind-down were 

$1.1 billion through 2022, most of which were recognized in 
2021. Citi does not expect to record any additional charges in 
connection with the Korea VERP. 

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K for details on the pension impact of the 
Korea wind-down.

Wind-Down of Russia Consumer and Institutional Banking 
Businesses
On August 25, 2022, Citi announced its decision to wind 
down its consumer banking and local commercial banking 
operations in Russia. As part of the wind-down, Citi is also 
actively pursuing sales of certain Russian consumer banking 
portfolios.

On October 14, 2022, Citi disclosed that it will be ending 

nearly all of the institutional banking services it offers in 
Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Going forward, 
Citi’s only operations in Russia will be those necessary to 
fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations.

On December 12, 2022, Citi completed the sale of a 

portfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment loans, 
totaling approximately $240 million in outstanding loan 
balances, to Uralsib, a Russian commercial bank, resulting in a 
pretax net loss of approximately $12 million. The net loss on 
sale of the loan portfolio included a $32 million adjustment to 
record the loans at lower of cost or fair value recognized in 
Other revenue. In addition, the sale of the loans resulted in a 
release in the allowance for credit losses on loans of 
approximately $20 million recognized in the Provision for 
credit losses on loans.

 During the second quarter of 2023, Citi recorded an 

incremental gain of $5 million related to post-closing 
contingency payments for the previously disclosed personal 
installment loan sale in Other revenue. The previously 
disclosed sale of a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal 
installment loans resulted in a pretax net loss on sale of 
approximately $7 million.

 Citi’s previously disclosed referral agreement with a 
Russian bank to settle a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit 
card loans, subject to customer consents, was signed in May 
2023 and is in the execution phase. The outstanding amount 
with Citi is to be settled upon referral and refinancing. As a 
result, the portfolio will remain held-for-investment and will 
not be transferred to held-for-sale. 

During the second quarter of 2023, Citi recorded a pretax 

release of approximately $1 million and a pretax charge of 
approximately $2 million (approximately $29 million and 
$12 million program-to-date) as Compensation and benefits 
composed of severance costs, reported in Legacy Franchises 
and Institutional Clients Group, respectively. Citi also 
recorded a pretax charge of approximately $4 million 
(approximately $17 million program-to-date) as Other 
operating expenses composed of vendor termination and other 
costs, reported in Legacy Franchises.

In connection with this wind-down, Citi expects to incur 

approximately $180 million in total estimated charges 
($40 million in ICG and $140 million in Legacy Franchises, 
excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), of which 
approximately $58 million has been incurred program-to-date, 
largely driven by restructuring, vendor termination fees and 
other related charges.

3.  OPERATING SEGMENTS

The operating segments and reporting units reflect how the 
CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker, manages the 
Company, including allocating resources and measuring 
performance. 

Citigroup’s activities are conducted through three 
operating segments: Institutional Clients Group (ICG), 
Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) and 
Legacy Franchises, with Corporate/Other including activities 
not assigned to a specific operating segment, as well as 
discontinued operations.

 ICG consists of Services, Markets and Banking, 
providing corporate, institutional and public sector clients 
around the world with a full range of wholesale banking 
products and services.

PBWM consists of U.S. Personal Banking and Global 

Wealth Management (Global Wealth), providing traditional 
banking services and credit cards to retail and small business 
customers primarily in the U.S., and financial services to 
clients from affluent to ultra-high-net-worth through banking, 
lending, mortgages, investment, custody and trust product 
offerings in 20 countries, including the U.S., Mexico and the 
four wealth management centers: Singapore, Hong Kong, the 
UAE and London.

Legacy Franchises consists of Asia Consumer and 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM businesses that Citi intends to exit, 
and its remaining Legacy Holdings Assets. 

Corporate/Other includes activities not assigned to the 

operating segments, including certain unallocated costs of 
global functions, other corporate expenses and corporate 
treasury results, offsets to certain line-item reclassifications 
and eliminations, and unallocated taxes, as well as 
discontinued operations.

Revenues and expenses directly associated with each 
respective business segment or component are included in 
determining respective operating results. Other revenues and 
expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular 
business segment or component are generally allocated from 
Corporate/Other based on respective net revenues, non-
interest expenses or other relevant measures.

As a result of revenues and expenses from transactions 
with other operating segments or components being treated as 
transactions with external parties for purposes of segment 
disclosures, the Company includes intersegment eliminations 
within Corporate/Other to reconcile the business segment 
results to Citi’s consolidated results.

The accounting policies of these operating segments are 

the same as those disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 

     100

(1) Citi’s consumer credit card programs have certain partner sharing agreements that vary by partner. These agreements are subject to contractually based 

performance thresholds that, if met, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is 
generally calculated based on predefined program revenues less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi’s partner sharing agreements, program expenses 
include net credit losses and, to the extent that an increase in net credit losses reduces Citi’s liability for the partners’ share for a given program year, would 
generally result in lower payments to partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other partner payments are based on program sales 
and new account acquisitions.

(2) Overdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310. Citi eliminated overdraft fees, returned item fees and overdraft protection fees beginning in June 2022. Includes 
overdraft fees (prior to the elimination of overdraft fees in June 2022) of $0 and $28 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

(3) Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and underwriting loan syndications or related financing activity. This activity is accounted for under ASC 310.
(4) Commissions and fees include $(2,940) million and $(2,811) million not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for the three 
months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $(5,599) million and $(5,240) million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Amounts reported in Commissions and fees accounted for under other guidance primarily include card-related loan fees, card reward programs and certain partner 
payments, corporate finance fees, insurance premiums and loan servicing fees.

6.  PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and 
unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading 
activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit 
and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions 
that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below 
based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk (as 
such, the trading desks can be periodically reorganized and 
thus the risk categories). Not included in the table below is the 
impact of net interest income related to trading activities, 
which is an integral part of trading activities’ profitability (see 
Note 4 for information about net interest income related to 
trading activities). Principal transactions include CVA (credit 
valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation 
adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains 
(losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in ICG. These 
adjustments are discussed further in Note 22. 

In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these 

fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.

(1) The U.S. qualified pension plan is fully funded under specified Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), funding rules as of 

January 1, 2023 and no minimum required funding is expected for 2023.

(2) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.
(3) The framework for the Company’s pension oversight process includes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all plans. Settlement accounting is triggered 
when either the sum of all settlements (including lump-sum payments) for the year is greater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of the plan’s 
projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because some of Citi’s significant plans are frozen and have no material service cost, settlement accounting may apply 
in the future.

(1)  The above tables do not include securities-for-securities lending 
transactions of $5.9 billion and $4.4 billion at June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022, respectively, where the Company acts as lender and 
receives securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral. In these 
transactions, the Company recognizes the securities received at fair 
value within Other assets and the obligation to return those securities as 
a liability within Brokerage payables.

(2)   See Note 14 for further information.

It is the Company’s policy to take possession of the 
underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the 
amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, 
require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to 
maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and 
repurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts 
additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin 
protection. 

A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase 
agreements is recorded at fair value as the Company elected 
the fair value option, as described in Notes 22 and 23. The 
remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially 
advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the 
respective agreements.

A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending 

agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or 
received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the 
Company elected the fair value option for certain securities 
borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 23. With 
respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash 
collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value 
of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market 
value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily 
basis and posts or obtains additional collateral in order to 
maintain contractual margin protection. 

The following tables present the gross and net resale and 
repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending 
agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under 
ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts related to 
financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under 
ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting to the 
extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion 
supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has been 
obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by 
financial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or 
been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability 
of the offsetting right.

(6)  Not included in the balances above is approximately $2 billion of accrued interest receivable at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, which is included in Other 
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable for AFS and HTM debt 
securities, consistent with its non-accrual policy, which results in timely write-off of accrued interest. The Company did not reverse through interest income any 
accrued interest receivables for the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

(1) The Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which are typically issued by VIEs through securitization transactions. The Company’s maximum 
exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. See Note 20 for mortgage- and asset-
backed securitizations in which the Company has other involvement.
In January 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-01. Upon adoption, Citi transferred $3.3 billion of mortgage-backed securities from HTM classification to AFS 
classification as allowed under the ASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of $0.1 billion, which was recorded in AOCI 
upon transfer. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Evaluating Investments for Impairment—AFS Debt 
Securities

Overview
The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt 
securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the 
impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other 
factors and to evaluate the Company’s intent to sell such 
securities.

For more information on evaluating investments for 

impairment, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Recognition and Measurement of Impairment 
The following table presents total impairment on AFS investments recognized in earnings:

In millions of dollars

Impairment losses related to debt securities that the Company does not intend to sell 
nor will likely be required to sell:

Total impairment losses recognized during the period

Less: portion of impairment loss recognized in AOCI (before taxes)

Net impairment losses recognized in earnings for debt securities that the Company 
does not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell

Impairment losses recognized in earnings for debt securities that the Company 
intends to sell, would more-likely-than-not be required to sell or will be subject 
to an issuer call deemed probable of exercise

Total impairment losses recognized in earnings

Allowance for Credit Losses on AFS Debt Securities
The allowance for credit losses on AFS securities held that the 
Company does not intend to sell nor will likely be required to 
sell was $5 million and $3 million as of June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022, respectively.

A similar impairment analysis is performed for non-
marketable equity securities carried at cost. For the three 
months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there was no 
impairment loss recognized in earnings for non-marketable 
equity securities carried at cost.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at 
Fair Value
Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured 
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the 
investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal 
Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue 
to be carried at cost. 

The election to measure a non-marketable equity security 

using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-
by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an 
equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes 
resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the 
identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The 
carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value 
on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ 
from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, 
including marketability adjustments and differences in rights 
and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the 
identical investment held by Citi.

Equity securities under the measurement alternative are 

also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, 
management qualitatively assesses whether each equity 
security under the measurement alternative is impaired. For 
details on impairment indicators that are considered, see Note 
13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 
Form 10-K. 

When the qualitative assessment indicates that the equity 

security is impaired, its fair value is determined. If the fair 
value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the 
investment is written down to fair value through earnings. 
Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity 
securities measured using the measurement alternative at 
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Company did not have significant purchases of corporate loans 
classified as held-for-investment for the three and six months

13.  LOANS

Citigroup loans are reported in two categories: corporate and 
consumer. These categories are classified primarily according 
to the operating segment and component that manage the loans 
in addition to the nature of the obligor, with corporate loans 
generally made for corporate institutional and public sector 
clients around the world and consumer loans to retail and 
small business customers. For additional information 
regarding Citi’s corporate and consumer loans, including 
related accounting policies, see Note 1 and Notes 1 and 14 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-
K.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is 
included in offices outside North America. The classification between 
offices in North America and outside North America is based on the 
domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the 
booking unit and the domicile of the managing unit is not material. 

(2) Loans secured primarily by real estate.
(3) Corporate loans are net of unearned income of ($795) million and ($797) 
million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Unearned 
income on corporate loans primarily represents interest received in 
advance, but not yet earned, on loans originated on a discounted basis.

(4) Not included in the balances above is approximately $2 billion of 

accrued interest receivable at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 
which is included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
(5) Accrued interest receivable considered to be uncollectible is reversed 
through interest income. Amounts reversed were not material for the 
three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

(1) Corporate loans that are 90 days past due are generally classified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past due when principal or interest is 

contractually due but unpaid.

(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90 days or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes, based on actual experience and a forward-

looking assessment of the collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of interest and/or principal is doubtful.

(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.
(4) The Total loans column includes loans at fair value, which are not included in the various delinquency columns, and therefore the tables’ total rows will not cross-

foot.

(1) Recorded investment in a loan includes net deferred loan fees and costs, unamortized premium or discount, less any direct write-downs.
(2) There were no significant revolving line of credit arrangements that converted to term loans during the quarter.
(3) Held-for-investment loans are accounted for on an amortized cost basis.
Includes certain short-term loans with less than one year in tenor.
(4)
(5) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions. 
(6) Loans at fair value include loans to commercial and industrial, financial institutions, mortgage and real estate and other.
(7)

In the first quarter of 2023, Citi identified that at December 31, 2022 certain loans originated prior to 2022 were disclosed as originating in 2022. The table above 
has been revised to reflect the correct origination year. Citi evaluated the effect of the revision, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and concluded that the impact 
of the revision was not material. The impact of the revision increased (decreased) the year of origination amounts as follows: $(24.9) billion, $2.0 billion, 
$3.2 billion, $4.6 billion, $4.1 billion and $11.0 billion for 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and prior, respectively.

Corporate Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
Citi seeks to modify certain corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to reduce Citi’s exposure to loss, often 
providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties. Each modification is unique to the borrower’s 
individual circumstances. The following table details corporate loan modifications granted during the three and six months ended 
June 30, 2023 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted and the financial effect of those 
modifications. Citi defines a corporate loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as a modification of a loan 
classified as substandard or worse at the time of modification.

(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period. The balances are not significant as a percentage of the total carrying 

values of loans by class of receivable as of June 30, 2023.

(2) Commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were granted modifications totaled $492 million as of June 30, 2023.
(3) The allowance for corporate loans, including modified loans, is based on the borrower’s overall financial performance. Charge-offs for amounts deemed 

uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the modification or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of 
modification.

(4) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.
(5) Payment delays either for principal or interest payments had an immaterial financial impact. 

The following table presents the Company’s three and six months ended June 30, 2022 corporate troubled debt restructurings

(1)  TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal payments. 
Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans’ projected cash flows and thus little to no 
impact on the allowance established for the loans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have 
already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification.
(2)  TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate.
(3)  Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.

(1) Corporate loans are generally not modified as a result of their delinquency status; rather, they are modified because of events that have impacted the overall 

financial performance of the borrower. Corporate loans, if past due, are re-aged to current status upon modification. 

(2) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.

Defaults of Modified Corporate Loans
No modified corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty defaulted during the three and six months ended June 30, 
2023. Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 
90 days past due. For a modified corporate loan that is not collateral dependent, expected default rates are considered in the loan’s 
individually assessed ACL.

The following table presents the Company’s three and six months ended June 30, 2022 corporate TDRs, under previous GAAP, 

prior to the Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, that defaulted for which the payment default occurred 
within one year of a permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due:

Consumer Loans
Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily 
by PBWM and Legacy Franchises (except Mexico SBMM). 
The tables below present details about these loans, including 
the following loan categories:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Residential first mortgages and Home equity loans in 
North America offices primarily represent secured 
mortgage lending to customers of Retail banking and 
Global Wealth (primarily Private bank and Citigold).
Credit cards in North America offices primarily represent 
unsecured credit card lending to customers of Branded 
cards and Retail services.
Personal, small business and other loans in North America 
are primarily composed of classifiably managed loans to 
customers of Global Wealth (mostly within the Private 
bank) who are typically high credit quality borrowers that 
historically experienced minimal delinquencies and credit 
losses. Loans to these borrowers are generally well 
collateralized in the form of liquid securities and other 
forms of collateral.
Residential mortgage loans in offices outside North 
America primarily represent secured mortgage lending to 
customers of Global Wealth (primarily Private bank and 
Citigold) as well as customers of Legacy Franchises.
Credit cards in offices outside North America primarily 
represent unsecured credit card lending to customers of 
PBWM and Legacy Franchises, primarily in Asia and 
Mexico.
Personal, small business and other loans in offices outside 
North America are primarily composed of secured and 
unsecured loans to customers of PBWM and Legacy 
Franchises. A significant portion of PBWM loans is 
classifiably managed and represents loans to high credit 
quality Private bank customers who have historically 
experienced minimal delinquencies and credit losses. 
Loans to these borrowers are generally well collateralized 
in the form of liquid securities and other forms of 
collateral.

(4) Loans modified under Citi’s COVID-19 consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of 

modification. Most modified loans in North America would not be reported as 30–89 or 90+ days past due for the duration of the programs (which have various 
durations, and certain of which may be renewed).

(5) Consists of loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are 30–89 days past due of $0.1 billion and $0.1 billion and 90 days or more 

past due of $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

June 30, 2023 approximately 99% were rated investment grade; and $26.0 billion outside North America, approximately $17.9 billion of which are classifiably 
managed, and as of June 30, 2023 approximately 93% were rated investment grade. Includes loans related to the Global Wealth business: $34.0 billion in North 
America, approximately $31.5 billion of which are classifiably managed, and as of December 31, 2022 approximately 98% were rated investment grade; and 
$26.6 billion outside North America, approximately $17.8 billion of which are classifiably managed, and as of December 31, 2022 approximately 94% were rated 
investment grade. The classifiably managed portion of these loans is shown as “current” because the delinquency status is not applicable, since these loans are 
primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk classification. 

(11) Consumer loans are net of unearned income of $769 million and $712 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Unearned income on 

consumer loans primarily represents unamortized origination fees and costs, premiums and discounts.

(12) Not included in the balances above are approximately $1 billion and $1 billion of accrued interest receivable at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 

respectively, which are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for credit card loans (which include accrued interest and fees). When a 
loan becomes non-accrual or, if not subject to a non-accrual policy, is charged off per the Company’s charge-off policy, any accrued interest receivable is also 
reversed against the interest income. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company reversed accrued interest of approximately $0.3 billion 
and $0.5 billion, respectively, primarily related to credit card loans. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company reversed accrued interest 
of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, primarily related to credit card loans.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the 
Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale $2 million 
and $1.8 billion of consumer loans, respectively. During the 
three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company sold 
and/or reclassified to held-for-sale $367 million and 
$374 million of consumer loans, respectively. The increase 
was due to the reclassification of a portfolio to HFS in the first 
quarter of 2023. The Company did not have significant 
purchases of consumer loans classified as held-for-investment 
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 or 2022. 
Loans held by a business for sale are not included in the above 
since they have been reclassified to Other assets. See Note 2 
for additional information regarding Citigroup’s businesses 
held-for-sale.

Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)
The following tables provide details on the Fair Isaac 
Corporation (FICO) scores for Citi’s U.S. consumer loan 
portfolio based on end-of-period receivables by year of 
origination. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially 
all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the 
remaining portfolio. With respect to Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolio outside of the U.S. as of June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022 ($79.3 billion and $80.5 billion, 

respectively), various country-specific or regional credit risk 
metrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are 
leveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality of 
customers (for additional information on loans outside of the 
U.S., see “Consumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North 
America” below). As a result, details of relevant credit quality 
indicators for those loans are not comparable to the below 
FICO score distribution for the U.S. portfolio.

(1)  The FICO bands in the tables are consistent with general industry peer presentations.
(2)  FICO scores are updated on either a monthly or quarterly basis. For updates that are made only quarterly, certain current-period loans by year of origination are 
greater than those disclosed in the prior periods. Loans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated with FICO scores as they become 
available.

(3)  These personal, small business and other loans without a FICO score available include $30.6 billion and $31.5 billion of Private bank loans as of June 30, 2023 

and December 31, 2022, respectively, which are classifiably managed within Global Wealth and are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk 
ratings. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately 99% and 98% of these loans, respectively, were rated investment grade.
(4)  FICO scores not available related to loans guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises for which FICO scores are generally not utilized.
(5)  Not included in the tables above are $63 million and $75 million of revolving credit card loans outside of the U.S. that were converted to term loans as of June 30, 

2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

(6)  Excludes $599 million and $545 million of balances related to Canada for June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
(7)  Excludes $919 million and $940 million of balances related to Canada for June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
(8) 

Includes approximately $49 million and $67 million of personal revolving loans that were converted to term loans for June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 
respectively.

Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios—U.S. Consumer Mortgages
LTV ratios (loan balance divided by appraised value) are 
calculated at origination and updated by applying market price 
data.

The following tables provide details on the LTV ratios for 

Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage portfolios by year of 
origination. LTV ratios are updated monthly using the most 
recent Core Logic Home Price Index data available for 
substantially all of the portfolio applied at the Metropolitan 
Statistical Area level, if available, or the state level if not. The 
remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar manner using 
the Federal Housing Finance Agency indices.

Consumer Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing 
Financial Difficulty
Citi seeks to modify consumer loans to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty to minimize losses, avoid 
foreclosure or repossession of collateral, and ultimately 
maximize payments received from the borrowers. Citi uses 
various metrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty, with the primary indicator being 
delinquency at the time of modification. Citi’s significant 
consumer modification programs are described below.

Credit Cards
Citi seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification 
programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the 
interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed 
payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the 
customer’s available line of credit. Citi also grants 
modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-
party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure 
customers’ entire unsecured debt. In both circumstances, if the 
cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, 
the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be 
charged off in accordance with Citi’s standard charge-off 
policy. In certain situations, Citi may forgive a portion of an 
outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount. 

Residential Mortgages
Citi seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers who are 
experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering interest 
rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term 
extensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in 
forbearance programs typically have payments suspended until 
the end of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before 
permanently modifying the contractual payment terms of a 
mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the 
borrower. Trial modifications generally represent a three-
month period during which the borrower makes monthly 
payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. 
These loans continue to age and accrue interest in accordance 
with their original contractual terms. Upon successful 
completion of the trial period, and the borrower’s formal 
acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower enter 
into a permanent modification. Citi expects the majority of 
loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be enrolled in a 
permanent modification. During the three and six months 
ended June 30, 2023, $15 million and $26 million, 
respectively, of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial 
programs. Mortgage loans of $1 million and $2 million had 
gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the three and six 
months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.

(1)  The above tables reflect activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, Citi granted 
forgiveness of $16 million and $26 million, respectively, in credit card loans, and $1 million and $1 million, respectively, in personal, small business and other 
loans that had no outstanding balance at June 30, 2023. 

(2)  Commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were granted modifications included in the tables above were immaterial at June 30, 

2023.

(3)  For major consumer portfolios, the ACLL is based on macroeconomic-sensitive models that rely on historical performance and macroeconomic scenarios to 

forecast expected credit losses. Modifications of consumer loans impact expected credit losses by affecting the likelihood of default.

(4)  Residential mortgages in offices outside North America were granted four months of payment deferrals during the six months ended December 31, 2022.
(5)  North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.

June 30, 2022, based on previously received OCC guidance.

(4) Represents portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing, but still due from the borrower. Such deferred principal is charged off at the time of 

permanent modification to the extent that the related loan balance exceeds the underlying collateral value.

(5) Represents portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing and, depending upon borrower performance, eligible for forgiveness.
(6) Represents portion of contractual loan principal that was forgiven at the time of permanent modification.
(7)  The above tables reflect activity for restructured loans that were considered TDRs during the reporting period.
(8)  Post-modification balances in North America include $2 million of residential first mortgages to borrowers who have gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the

(1)  North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.
(2)  Typically, upon modification a loan re-ages to current. However, FFIEC guidelines for re-aging certain loans require that at least three consecutive minimum 
monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, be received. In these cases, the loan will remain delinquent until the payment criteria for re-aging have been 
satisfied.

(3)  Loans modified under Citi’s COVID-19 consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of 

modification.

2Q23 Changes in the ACL
The total allowance for credit losses on loans, leases and 
unfunded lending commitments as of June 30, 2023 was 
$19,358 million, a slight increase from $19,125 million at 
December 31, 2022. The increase in the ACLL was primarily 
driven by growth in card balances in Branded cards and Retail 
services and an increase in transfer risk associated with 
exposures outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness 
considerations under U.S. banking law, partially offset by a 
decrease in the ACLL of $352 million from the adoption of 
ASU 2022-02 for the recognition and measurement of TDRs 
(see Note 1) and an improved macroeconomic outlook.

Consumer ACLL
Citi’s total consumer allowance for credit losses on loans 
(ACLL) as of June 30, 2023 was $14,866 million, an increase 
from $14,119 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was 
primarily driven by growth in U.S. cards balances, partially 
offset by a decrease to the ACLL of $352 million from the 
adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the recognition and 
measurement of TDRs.

Corporate ACLL
Citi’s total corporate ACLL as of June 30, 2023 was $2,630 
million, a decrease from $2,855 million at December 31, 2022. 
The decrease was primarily driven by an improved 
macroeconomic outlook.

ACLUC
As of June 30, 2023, Citi’s total ACLUC, included in Other 
liabilities, was $1,862 million, a decrease from $2,151 million 
at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by 
an improved macroeconomic outlook.

Citi tests goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual test if 
an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying 
amount. No such events or circumstances were identified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of June 30, 2023. For 
additional information regarding Citi’s goodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 

While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations of the reporting units, the 

economic and business environments continue to evolve as Citi’s management implements its strategic refresh. If management’s 
future estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially 
experience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.

(4)  Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and non-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These SPEs are not consolidated.
(5)   Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored private equity funds, which represent $11 billion and $69 billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and 

$534 million and $498 million in maximum exposure to loss as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The previous tables do not include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

certain investment funds for which the Company provides 
investment management services and personal estate 
trusts for which the Company provides administrative, 
trustee and/or investment management services;
certain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to 
which the Company provides secured credit facilities. The 
Company has no decision-making power and does not 
consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the 
definition of a VIE. The Company’s maximum exposure 
to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related 
commitment. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 
2022, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss related 
to these transactions was $16.8 billion and $33.6 billion, 
respectively (for more information on these positions, see 
Note 13 and Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K);
certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the 
Company holds securities in inventory, as these 
investments are made on arm’s-length terms;
certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities 
held by the Company, which are classified as Trading 
account assets or Investments, in which the Company has 
no other involvement with the related securitization entity 
deemed to be significant (see Notes 12 and 21 for more 
information on these positions);
certain representations and warranties exposures in 
Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which 
the original mortgage loan balances are no longer 
outstanding; and
VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection 
with the Company’s funding activities. The Company 
does not have a variable interest in these trusts.

The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the 
carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. 
The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the 
current fair value of the assets depending on the classification 
of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated 
accounting model ascribed to that classification.

The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the 

Company has significant involvement represent the most 
current information available to the Company. In most cases, 
the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without 
regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily 
available to the Company.

The maximum funded exposure represents the balance 
sheet carrying amount of the Company’s investment in the 
VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, 
adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments 
received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for 
increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value 
recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded 
positions represents the remaining undrawn committed 
amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by 
the Company or the notional amount of a derivative 
instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain 
transactions, the Company has entered into derivative 
instruments or other arrangements that are not considered 
variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-
currency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of 
credit protection under a credit default swap or total return 
swap where the Company pays the total return on certain 
assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are 
not included in the maximum exposure amounts.

     161                                                                                                                                                                                                            

The following tables present certain assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are included on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets in the table below include those assets that can only be used to settle obligations of 
consolidated VIEs and are in excess of those obligations. In addition, the assets in the table below include third-party assets of 
consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities in the table below include 
third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also 
exclude amounts where creditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to the general credit of Citigroup.

Credit Card Securitizations
The Company’s primary credit card securitization activity is 
through two trusts—Citibank Credit Card Master Trust and 
Citibank Omni Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities 
given Citi’s continuing involvement. For additional 
information, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. There were no material 
cash flows arising from either proceeds from new 
securitizations or paydowns of maturing notes during the six 
months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)
The fair value of Citi’s capitalized MSRs was $681 million 
and $600 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 
MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $51 billion and 
$49 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The

(1)  Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of time.

The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by 
changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in 
mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend 
to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value 
of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup 
economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its 
MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, 
forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed 
securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading

Re-securitizations
The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in 
which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for 
new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency 
(private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the 
three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. These securities 
are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and 
are often structured on behalf of clients.

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Citi held no 
retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions 
structured by Citi. 

The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-

agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. 
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, Citi 
transferred agency securities with a fair value of 
approximately $3.3 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, to re-
securitization entities, compared to approximately $5.6 billion 
and $14.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2022, respectively. 

As of June 30, 2023, the fair value of Citi-retained 
interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by 
Citi totaled approximately $1.4 billion (including $402 million 
related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2023), 
compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 (including 

     165                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
 
 
$801 million related to re-securitization transactions executed 
in 2022), which is recorded in Trading account assets. The 
original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in 
which Citi holds a retained interest as of June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022 were approximately $86.8 billion and 
$79.4 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the 
Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-
securitization entities.

Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper 
Conduits
At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the commercial 
paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately 
$18.6 billion and $19.6 billion of purchased assets 
outstanding, respectively, and had incremental funding 
commitments with clients of approximately $16.1 billion and 
$13.9 billion, respectively.

Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the 
form of short-term commercial paper. At June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining lives of 
the commercial paper issued by the conduits were 
approximately 66 and 64 days, respectively.

Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with 
transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by 
the third-party client seller, including over-collateralization, 
cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or 
third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized 
with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or 
above, based on Citi’s internal risk ratings. In addition to the 
transaction-specific credit enhancements, the conduits, other 
than the government-guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained 
letters of credit from the Company, which equal at least 8% to 
10% of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of $350 million. 
The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits 

total approximately $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion as of June 30, 
2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The net result 
across multiseller conduits administered by the Company is 
that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-
specific credit enhancements described above, any losses in 
each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the 
commercial paper investors.

At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company 

owned $7.7 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, of the 
commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The 
Company’s investments were not driven by market illiquidity 
and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to 
purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.

Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts
At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, none of the 
municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were 
subject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company.
At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, liquidity 

agreements provided with respect to customer TOB trusts 
totaled $0.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of which 
$0.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, were offset by 
reimbursement agreements. For the remaining exposure 
related to TOB transactions, where the residual owned by the 
customer was at least 25% of the bond value at the inception 
of the transaction, no reimbursement agreement was executed.
The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or 

letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment 
funds, which are not variable interest entities, and 
municipality-related issuers that totaled $1.4 billion and $1.4 
billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 
respectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit 
are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out 
provisions.

Asset-Based Financing
The primary types of Citi’s asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi’s 
maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with 
no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.

21.  DERIVATIVES

In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into 
various types of derivative transactions. All derivatives are 
recorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information 
regarding Citi’s use of and accounting for derivatives, see 
Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 
2022 Form 10-K.

Information pertaining to Citigroup’s derivatives 

activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table 
below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts 
from which contractual payments are derived and do not 
represent a complete measure of Citi’s exposure to derivative 
transactions. Citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from 

market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure 
(i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial 
stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation 
adjustments that may be required on the transactions. 
Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the netting of 
offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-
fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets 
this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with 
a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is 
reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de 
minimis overall market risk. 

In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can 

fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of 
business based on Citi’s market share, levels of client activity 
and other factors.

(1) Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection purchaser) to transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” to another party (protection 
seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The 
Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of 
overall risk.

     167                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following tables present the gross and net fair values 

of the Company’s derivative transactions and the related 
offsetting amounts as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 
2022. Gross positive fair values are offset against gross 
negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable 
master netting agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables 
and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or 
paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex 
are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion 
supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights 
has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting 
for security collateral.

In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes 
adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities 
to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related 
variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair 
values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to 
presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are 
subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also 
record a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables 
also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset, such 
as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party 
custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the 
extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion 
supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights 
has been obtained.

     168

(1) The derivative fair values are also presented in Note 22. 
(2) Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are derivatives executed and settled bilaterally with counterparties without the use of an organized exchange or central 

clearing house. Cleared derivatives include derivatives executed bilaterally with a counterparty in the OTC market, but then novated to a central clearing house, 
whereby the central clearing house becomes the counterparty to both of the original counterparties. Exchange-traded derivatives include derivatives executed 
directly on an organized exchange that provides pre-trade price transparency.

(3) Represents the netting of balances with the same counterparty under enforceable netting agreements. Approximately $241 billion, $48 billion and $24 billion of 

the netting against trading account asset/liability balances is attributable to each of the OTC, cleared and exchange-traded derivatives, respectively.
(4) Represents the netting of cash collateral paid and received by counterparties under enforceable credit support agreements. Substantially all netting of cash 

collateral received and paid is against OTC derivative assets and liabilities, respectively.

(5) The net receivables/payables include approximately $14 billion of derivative asset and $9 billion of derivative liability fair values not subject to enforceable 

master netting agreements, respectively.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 
2022, amounts recognized in Principal transactions in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income include certain derivatives 
not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship. Citigroup 
presents this disclosure by business classification, showing 
derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities 
together with gains and losses related to non-derivative 
instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this 
represents how these portfolios are risk managed. See Note 6 
for further information. 

The amounts recognized in Other revenue in the 

Consolidated Statement of Income related to derivatives not 
designated in a qualifying hedging relationship are presented 
below. The table below does not include any offsetting gains 
(losses) on the economically hedged items to the extent that 
such amounts are also recorded in Other revenue.

(1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are included in Interest income/Interest expense. The accrued interest income on fair value hedges is recorded in 

Net interest income and is excluded from this table. Amounts included both hedges of AFS securities and long-term debt on a net basis, which largely offset in the 
current period.

(2) Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected 
directly in earnings under the mark-to-market approach. Amounts related to cross-currency basis, which are recognized in AOCI, are not reflected in the table 
above. The amount of cross-currency basis included in AOCI was $22 million and $(4) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and $12 million 
and $76 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.

(3) Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness reflected directly in earnings 

under the mark-to-market approach or recorded in AOCI under the amortization approach. The quarter ended June 30, 2023 includes gain (loss) of approximately 
$41 million and $11 million under the mark-to-market approach and amortization approach, respectively. The quarter ended June 30, 2022 includes gain (loss) of 
approximately $(28) million and $2 million under the mark-to-market approach and amortization approach, respectively.

(4) The gain (loss) amounts for commodity hedges are included in Principal transactions for periods beginning 2023.

     172                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cumulative Basis Adjustment 
Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, 
the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the 
cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative basis 
adjustment becomes part of the carrying amount of the hedged 
item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance 
sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi’s 
hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges 
at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, along with the 
cumulative basis adjustments included in the carrying value of 
those hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through 
earnings in future periods.

(2) These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of $(201) million 
for active hedges and $(283) million for de-designated hedges as of 
June 30, 2023, related to certain financial assets previously designated as 
the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the portfolio layer approach. 
The Company designated approximately $7 billion as the hedged 
amount (from a closed portfolio of financial assets with a carrying value 
of $13 billion as of June 30, 2023) in a portfolio layer hedging 
relationship.

(3) These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of $(91) million 

for active hedges and $(309) million for de-designated hedges as of 
December 31, 2022, related to certain prepayable financial assets 
previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the 
last-of-layer approach. The Company designated approximately $3 
billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of prepayable 
financial assets with a carrying value of $11 billion as of December 31, 
2022) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship.

(4) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.

Cash Flow Hedges
Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due 
to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated 
with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted 
transactions. These cash flow hedging relationships use either 
regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess 
whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at 
inception and on an ongoing basis.

For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value 

of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then 
reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted 
hedged cash flows impact earnings. The net gain (loss) 
associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified 
from AOCI within 12 months of June 30, 2023 is 
approximately $(1.3) billion. The maximum length of time 
over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 13 years.

The pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is 
presented below. The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on 
AOCI is shown in Note 18.

Net Investment Hedges 
Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-currency 
swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated debt 
instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated 
with Citigroup’s equity investments in several non-U.S.-
dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records 
the change in the fair value of these hedging instruments and 
the translation adjustment for the investments in these foreign 
subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA) 
within AOCI.

The pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI, 

related to net investment hedges, was $(272) million and 
$(948) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2023 and $836 million and $641 million for the three and six 
months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. June 30, 2022 
includes a $47 million pretax loss related to net investment 
hedges that was reclassified from AOCI into earnings 
(recorded in Other revenue).

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives
Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require 
the Company to either post additional collateral or 
immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the 
occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the 
Company. These events, which are defined by the existing 
derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit 
ratings of the Company and its affiliates.

The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative 
instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that 
were in a net liability position at June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022 was $16 billion and $18 billion, 
respectively. The Company posted $14 billion and $15 billion 
as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business 
as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash 

settlement requirements for the Company and certain 
affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were 
downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies 
as of June 30, 2023, the Company could be required to post an 
additional $0.8 billion as either collateral or settlement of the 
derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be 
required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral 
previously received from existing derivative counterparties in 
the amount of $16 million upon the single notch downgrade, 
resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral 
requirements of approximately $0.8 billion.

Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers 
For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the 
Company, and for which the Company has retained 
substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred 
asset through a total return swap executed with the same 
counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still 
outstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross 
cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were 
$2.7 billion and $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022, respectively.

At June 30, 2023, the fair value of these previously 
derecognized assets was $2.7 billion. The fair value of the 
total return swaps as of June 30, 2023 was $39 million 
recorded as gross derivative assets and $24 million recorded as 
gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the fair 
value of these previously derecognized assets was $1.4 billion, 
and the fair value of the total return swaps was $27 million 
recorded as gross derivative assets and $32 million recorded as 
gross derivative liabilities.

The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross 

basis, before the application of counterparty and cash 
collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity 
derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.

     176                                                                                                                                                                                                            

22.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

For additional information regarding fair value measurement 
at Citi, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Fair Value Hierarchy
ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether 
the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs 
are developed using market data and reflect market participant 
assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s 
market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created 
the following fair value hierarchy:

•

•

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active 
markets.
Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active 
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments 
in markets that are not active and model-derived 
valuations in which all significant inputs and significant 
value drivers are observable in the market.
Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in 
which one or more significant inputs or significant value 
drivers are unobservable.

As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company 

considers relevant and observable market inputs in its 
valuations where possible. 

The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically 

utilizes rules-based and data-driven selection criteria to 
determine whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, 
Level 2 or Level 3:

•

•

•

The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in 
an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 
instrument is based upon the frequency of observed 
transactions and the quality of independent market data 
available on the measurement date. 
A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is 
observability of prices/market inputs to models, or where 
any unobservable inputs are not significant to the 
valuation. The determination of whether an input is 
considered observable is based on the availability of 
independent market data and its corroboration, for 
example through observed transactions in the market.
Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.

The table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments 
(CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) applied to

repurchase and (ii) derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement and cash collateral offsetting.
Includes positions related to investments in unallocated precious metals, as discussed in Note 23. Also includes physical commodities accounted for at the lower 
of cost or fair value and unfunded credit products.

(3) Amounts exclude $24 million of investments measured at net asset value (NAV) in accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): 

Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).

(4) Because the amount of the cash collateral paid/received has not been allocated to the Level 1, 2 and 3 subtotals, these percentages are calculated based on total 

assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding the cash collateral paid/received on derivatives.

(1) Represents netting of (i) the amounts due under securities purchased under agreements to resell and the amounts owed under securities sold under agreements to 

(2)

repurchase and (ii) derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement and cash collateral offsetting.
Includes positions related to investments in unallocated precious metals, as discussed in Note 23. Also includes physical commodities accounted for at the lower 
of cost or fair value and unfunded credit products.

(3) Represents the netting of cash collateral paid and received by counterparties under enforceable credit support agreements. Substantially all netting of cash 

collateral received and paid is against OTC derivative assets and liabilities, respectively.

(4) Amounts exclude $27 million of investments measured at NAV in accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for 

Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).

(5) Because the amount of the cash collateral paid/received has not been allocated to the Level 1, 2 and 3 subtotals, these percentages are calculated based on total 

assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding the cash collateral paid/received on derivatives.

Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Category 
The following tables present the changes in the Level 3 fair 
value category for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2023 and 2022. The gains and losses presented below include 
changes in the fair value related to both observable and 
unobservable inputs.

The Company often hedges positions with offsetting 
positions that are classified in a different level. For example, 

the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the Level 3 
category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect 
of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may 
be classified in the Level 1 or Level 2 categories. In addition, 
the Company hedges items classified in the Level 3 category 
with instruments also classified in Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. The hedged items and related hedges are presented 
gross in the following tables:

(1) Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) are presented as increase (decrease) to Level 3 assets, and as (increase) decrease to Level 3 liabilities. Changes in fair value 

of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in AOCI, unless related to credit impairment, while gains and losses from sales are recorded in Realized gains 
(losses) from sales of investments in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 

(2) Unrealized gains (losses) on MSRs are recorded in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
(3) Represents the amount of total gains or losses for the period, included in earnings (and AOCI for changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and 

DVA on fair value option liabilities), attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 that are still held at June 30, 2022.

(4) Total Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities have been netted in these tables for presentation purposes only.

Level 3 Fair Value Transfers 
The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the 
period December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023:

•

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, 
transfers of Long-term debt were $2.1 billion and 
$3.2 billion from Level 2 to Level 3, respectively. Of the 
$3.2 billion transfer, approximately $2.9 billion related to 
interest rate option volatility inputs becoming 
unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall 
valuation, and $0.3 billion related to equity and credit 
derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, 
e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable 
and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other 
instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs 
becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs 
becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the 
instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or 
deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in 
$1.3 billion and $6.1 billion of certain structured long-
term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to 
Level 2 during the three and six months ended June 30, 
2023, respectively.

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for 

the period December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2022:

•

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, 
transfers of Long-term debt were $3.3 billion and 
$6.7 billion, respectively, from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the 
$6.7 billion transfer in the six months ended June 30, 
2022, approximately $4.5 billion related to interest rate 
option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or 
significant relative to their overall valuation, and 
$2.2 billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs 
(in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate 
volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or 
significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, 
market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming 
more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming 
less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments 
(e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the 
money). This has primarily resulted in $2.6 billion and 
$3.5 billion of certain structured long-term debt products 
being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three 
and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.

     190                                                                                                                                                                                                            

    
Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value 
Measurements 
The following tables present the valuation techniques covering 
the majority of Level 3 inventory and the most significant 
unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements. 

Differences between this table and amounts presented in the 
Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward table represent individually 
immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of 
valuation techniques other than those listed.

(1) The tables above include the fair values for the items listed and may not foot to the total population for each category.
(2) Some inputs are shown as zero due to rounding.
(3) When the low and high inputs are the same, there is either a constant input applied to all positions, or the methodology involving the input applies to only one 

large position.

(4) Weighted averages are calculated based on the fair values of the instruments.
(5) For equity securities, the price inputs are expressed on an absolute basis, not as a percentage of the notional amount.
(6) Both trading and non-trading account derivatives—assets and liabilities—are presented on a gross absolute value basis.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the 
tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have 
been written down to fair value during the periods as a result 
of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity 
securities that have been measured using the measurement 
alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during 
the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward 
or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed 
during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the 
same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-
sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower 
of cost or market value.

The following tables present the carrying amounts of all 
assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value 
measurement was recorded:

(1) The carrying value of loans is net of the allowance for credit losses on loans of $17.5 billion for June 30, 2023 and $17.0 billion for December 31, 2022. In 
addition, the carrying values exclude $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion of lease finance receivables at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Includes items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
Includes cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables, reinsurance recoverables and other financial instruments included in Other assets 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

(2)
(3)

(4) The carrying value includes long-term debt balances under qualifying fair value hedges.
(5)

Includes brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, short-term borrowings (carried at cost) and other financial instruments included in Other liabilities 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s corporate 

unfunded lending commitments at June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022 were off-balance sheet liabilities of 
$8.1 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively, substantially all of 
which are classified as Level 3. The Company does not 
estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending 
commitments, which are generally cancelable by providing 
notice to the borrower.

23.  FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS

The Company may elect to report most financial instruments 
and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-
instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in 
earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made 
upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, 
financial liability or firm commitment or when certain 
specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election 
may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The 
changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. 
Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI. 
The Company has elected fair value accounting for its 
mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 20 for additional 
details on Citi’s MSRs. Additional discussion regarding other 
applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is 
presented in Note 22.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:

Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios 

are recorded in Principal transactions. The related interest 
revenue and interest expense are measured based on the 
contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported 
as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Certain Loans and Other Credit Products
Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain 
other originated and purchased loans, including certain 
unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of 
credit, executed by Citigroup’s lending and trading businesses. 
None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing 
commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans 
and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold 
or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the 
economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such 
as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where 
the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a 
third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to 
mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge 
accounting is complex and to achieve operational 
simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending 
transactions across the Company.

Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)
Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi’s 
liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected 
using Citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market. 
Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to 
changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected 
as a component of AOCI. See Note 18 for additional 
information.

Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for 
which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-
recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the 
narrowing or widening of the Company’s credit spreads.
The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-
derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company’s 
own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a 
loss of $(837) million and gain of $2,592 million for the three 
months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a loss 
of $(1,270) million and gain of $3,642 million for the six 
months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes 
in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific 
credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company’s 
current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the 
relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as 
described above. 

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities

Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under 
Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold 
Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and 
Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings
The Company elected the fair value option for certain 
portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under 
agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under 
agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities 
loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held 
primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the 
United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was 
made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a 
portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative 
instruments that are accounted for at fair value through 
earnings. 

The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value:

In addition to the amounts reported above, $651 million 
and $729 million of unfunded commitments related to certain 
credit products selected for fair value accounting were 
outstanding as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 
respectively.

Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit 

products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi’s 
Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest revenue is 
measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported 
as Interest revenue on Trading account assets or loan interest 
depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit 
products. The changes in fair value for the three months ended 
June 30, 2023 and 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk 
totaled to a loss of $25 million and $(47) million, respectively. 
Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are 
estimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit 
spreads and recovery assumptions.

Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals
Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts 
(e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its 
commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment 
is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity 
derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for 
the debt host contract, and reports the contract within Trading 
account assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across 
unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $0.6 
billion and $0.3 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 
2022, respectively.

As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades 
unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward 
purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading 
counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals 
investment, Citi’s receivable from its depository bank is repaid 
and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated 
precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the 
trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is 
accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. 

Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)
Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain 
purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming 
adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are 
intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with 
derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair 
value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where 
hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational 
simplifications.

The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value:

The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are 

reported in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value 
during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 due to 
instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to 
instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes 
in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in 
addition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest 
income continues to be measured based on the contractual 
interest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

Certain Debt Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt 
liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be 
trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair 
value basis. These positions are classified as Long-term debt 
or Short-term borrowings on the Company’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

transactions.

24.  GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS

Citi provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to 
its customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them 
to complete a wide range of business transactions. For certain 
contracts meeting the definition of a guarantee, the guarantor 
must recognize, at inception, a liability for the fair value of the 
obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

In addition, the guarantor must disclose the maximum 
potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could 
be required to make under the guarantee, if there were a total 
default by the guaranteed parties. The determination of the 
maximum potential future payments is based on the notional 

amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible 
recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or 
pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no 
relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these 
guarantees. 

For additional information regarding Citi’s guarantees and 

indemnifications included in the tables below, as well as its 
other guarantees and indemnifications excluded from these 
tables, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

(1) The carrying values of securities lending indemnifications were not material for either period presented, as the probability of potential liabilities arising from these 

guarantees is minimal.

(2) At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be approximately $128 billion and $130 billion, respectively. 

However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent 
liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.

     201                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Loans Sold with Recourse
Loans sold with recourse represent Citi’s obligations to 
reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain 
circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales 
agreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the 
buyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased 
loans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back 
any loans that become delinquent. 

In addition to the amounts presented in the tables above, 

Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for its potential 
repurchases or make-whole liability regarding residential 
mortgage representation and warranty claims related to its 
whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies and, 
to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase reserve 
was approximately $10 million and $10 million at June 30, 
2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and these amounts 
are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet.

Credit Card Arrangements with Partners
Citi, in one of its credit card partner arrangements, provides 
guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of certain 
customer originations during the term of the agreement. To the 
extent that such origination targets are not met, the guarantees 
serve to compensate the partner for certain payments that 
otherwise would have been generated in connection with such 
originations. 

Other Guarantees and Indemnifications

Credit Card Protection Programs
Citi, through its credit card businesses, provides various 
cardholder protection programs on several of its card products, 
including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental 
cars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased 
products, price protection for certain purchases and protection 
for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the 
table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and 
Citi’s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The 
protection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses, 
and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would 
qualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the 
probability and amount of its potential liability related to these 
programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss 
experience. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the 
actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of 
Citi’s obligations related to these programs were immaterial.

Value-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and 
Clearing Houses) (VTNs)
Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value-
transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement 
systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a 
condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that 
members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses 
incurred by the organization due to another member’s default 
on its obligations. Citi’s potential obligations may be limited 
to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the 
VTN’s funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata 
share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this 

would require an assessment of claims that have not yet 
occurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote 
given historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi’s 
participation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables 
above, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2023 or December 31, 2022 for 
potential obligations that could arise from Citi’s involvement 
with VTN associations.

Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance Indemnification
Citi has an indemnification contingency to Brighthouse 
Financial in connection with Citi’s sale of an insurance 
subsidiary. A liability under this indemnification agreement is 
currently remote because Brighthouse Financial would 
become responsible for LTC policyholder claims only when 
both the reinsurance provided by other parties ceases and trust 
assets set aside to meet these claims are not adequate. 
However, should events occur causing both the reinsurance 
protection and trust collateral to become insufficient to cover 
Brighthouse Financial’s LTC policyholder claims, Citi will be 
required to either estimate and disclose a reasonably possible 
loss or range of loss to the extent that such an estimate can be 
made, or to accrue for such liability if the event becomes 
probable and estimable. Citi continues to closely monitor its 
potential exposure under this indemnification obligation. For 
additional information, see Note 27 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing
Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties 
(CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-
the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on 
all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has concluded that it 
acts as an agent for accounting purposes in its role as clearing 
member for these client transactions. As such, Citi does not 
reflect the underlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives 
contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 
21 for a discussion of Citi’s derivatives activities that are 
reflected in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash and 

securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the 
respective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher 
amount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to 
remit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository 
institutions such as banks or carry brokers.

There are two types of margin: initial and variation. 
Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash initial 
margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial margin 
collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository 
institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables (payables 
to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables from 
brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and due 
from banks, respectively. 

However, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared 

derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from 
or control the client cash balances, the client cash initial 
margin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or 
depository institutions is not reflected on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi has 
contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass 

     202                                                                                                                                                                                                            

through to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository 
institutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize 
its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin into 
other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to 
the client for the performance of the CCP or the depository 
institution and (iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated 
from Citi’s bankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial 
margin collected and remitted in this manner was 
approximately $18.3 billion and $18.0 billion as of June 30, 
2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Variation margin due from clients to the respective CCP, 
or from the CCP to clients, reflects changes in the value of the 
client’s derivative contracts for each trading day. As a clearing 
member, Citi is exposed to the risk of non-performance by 
clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to the 
CCP for negative changes in the value of the client’s 
derivative contracts). In the event of non-performance by a 
client, Citi would move to close out the client’s positions. The 
CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client 
and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to 
be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds 
incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client, 
which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate 
Citi’s credit risk in the event the client fails to perform.

As required by ASC 860-30-25-5, securities collateral 
posted by clients is not recognized on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

Carrying Value—Guarantees and Indemnifications
At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total carrying 
amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and 
indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to 
approximately $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The 
carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is 
included in Other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the 
carrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities.

Collateral
Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized 
under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to 
$51.5 billion and $51.8 billion at June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022, respectively. Securities and other 
marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $73.4 billion 
and $63.7 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 
respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse 
losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In 
addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral 
amounted to $3.0 billion and $3.7 billion at June 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022, respectively. Other property may also be 
available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and 
indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not 
been determined.

     203                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Performance Risk
Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential 
amounts of future payments that are classified based on 
internal and external credit ratings. The determination of the 
maximum potential future payments is based on the notional 
amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible 
recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or 
pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no 
relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these 
guarantees.

(1) Consumer commitments related to the business HFS countries under sales agreements are reflected in their original categories until the respective sales are 

completed.

The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon 

customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial 
commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed 
expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees 
(net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of 
the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if 
exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment 
period.

Other Commitments and Contingencies
Other commitments and contingencies include all other 
transactions related to commitments and contingencies not 
reported on the lines above.

Unsettled Reverse Repurchase and Securities Borrowing 
Agreements and Unsettled Repurchase and Securities 
Lending Agreements
In addition, in the normal course of business, Citigroup enters 
into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, 
as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements, which 
settle at a future date. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 
2022, Citigroup had approximately $150.4 billion and 
$111.6 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase and securities 
borrowing agreements, and approximately $117.5 billion and 
$37.3 billion of unsettled repurchase and securities lending 
agreements, respectively. See Note 10 for a further discussion 
of securities purchased under agreements to resell and 
securities borrowed, and securities sold under agreements to 
repurchase and securities loaned, including the Company’s 
policy for offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase 
agreements.

Restricted Cash
Citigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to 
withdrawal restrictions) to include cash deposited with central 
banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory 
requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of customers 
or for other purposes such as compensating balance 
arrangements or debt retirement. Restricted cash may include 
minimum reserve requirements at certain central banks and 
cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of 
customer assets as required by Citigroup broker-dealers’ 
primary regulators, including the SEC, the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom’s 
Prudential Regulation Authority.

Restricted cash is included on the Consolidated Balance 

Sheet within the following balance sheet lines:

25.  LEASES

The Company’s operating leases, where Citi is a lessee, 
include real estate, such as office space and branches, and 
various types of equipment. These leases may contain renewal 
and extension options and early termination features; however, 
these options do not impact the lease term unless the Company 
is reasonably certain that it will exercise options. These leases 
have a weighted-average remaining lease term of 
approximately six years as of June 30, 2023. 

For additional information regarding Citi’s leases, see 
Notes 1 and 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. 

The following table presents information on the right-of-

use (ROU) asset and lease liabilities included in Premises and

The Company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straight-

line basis throughout the lease term in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. In addition, variable lease costs are 
recognized in the period in which the obligation for those 
payments is incurred.

26.  CONTINGENCIES

The following information supplements and amends, as 
applicable, the disclosure in Note 25 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in Citi’s First Quarter 2023 Form 10-Q 
and in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 
Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K. For purposes of this Note, Citigroup, 
its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers, 
directors, and employees, are sometimes collectively referred 
to as Citigroup and Related Parties.

In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes 

accruals for contingencies, including any litigation, regulatory, 
or tax matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is 
probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the 
loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals 
are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of 
additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred 
in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or 
lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. With 
respect to previously incurred loss contingencies for which 
recovery is expected, Citi applies loss recovery accounting 
when disputes and uncertainties affecting recognition are 
resolved.

If Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because the 
matter does not meet the criteria for accrual (as set forth 
above), or Citigroup believes an exposure to loss exists in 
excess of the amount accrued for a particular matter, in each 
case assuming a material loss is reasonably possible but not 
probable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In addition, for such 
matters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of the aggregate 
reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the 
amounts accrued for those matters for which an estimate can 
be made. At June 30, 2023, Citigroup estimates that the 
reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up 
to approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate.

As available information changes, the matters for which 

Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates 
themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates 
presented in financial statements and other financial 
disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to 
significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably 
possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other 
matters are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, at 
the time of making an estimate, Citigroup may only have 
preliminary or incomplete information about the facts 
underlying the claim; its assumptions about the future rulings 
of the court or other tribunal on significant issues, or the 
behavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators, or tax 
authorities may prove to be wrong; and the outcomes it is 
attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of 
statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, 
from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had 
not accounted for in its estimates because it had deemed such 
an outcome to be remote. For all these reasons, the amount of 
loss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for 
which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher 
or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.

Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup’s 
management, based on current knowledge and after taking into 
account its current accruals, that the eventual outcome of all 

matters described in this Note would not be likely to have a 
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition 
of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or 
indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and 
the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse 
outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time, 
have a material adverse effect on Citigroup’s consolidated 
results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or 
annual periods.

For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup’s 
accounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, 
including for any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters 
disclosed herein, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

FDIC Special Assessment
On May 11, 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking that would implement a special assessment—
primarily upon large banks—to recover the uninsured deposit 
losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature 
Bank. The FDIC estimated that of the cost of the failures of 
Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, approximately 
$15.8 billion was attributable to the protection of uninsured 
depositors, an estimate that will be periodically adjusted. The 
FDIC has proposed collecting the special assessment at an 
annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points of uninsured 
deposits over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning in 
2024. There is sufficient uncertainty around the final FDIC 
regulation that would impact both the timing and amount. If 
the final rule for the FDIC special assessment is enacted as 
proposed, which is expected before the end of 2023, Citi 
estimates that the impact would be significant, potentially a 
pretax charge of up to $1.5 billion. This amount is not 
included in the reasonably possible loss estimate above.

Equity Security Repurchases
All large banks, including Citi, are subject to limitations on 
capital distributions in the event of a breach of any regulatory 
capital buffers, including the Stress Capital Buffer, with the 
degree of such restrictions based on the extent to which the 
buffers are breached. For additional information, see “Capital 
Resources—Regulatory Capital Buffers” and “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

(1)  Repurchases not made pursuant to any publicly announced plan or program.
(2)  During the second quarter, pursuant to Citigroup’s Board of Directors’ authorization, Citi withheld an insignificant number of shares of common stock, added to 

treasury stock, related to activity on employee stock programs to satisfy the employee tax requirements. 

As previously announced, Citi will continue to assess common 
share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given 
uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements.

Dividends
Citi paid common dividends of $0.51 per share for the second 
quarter of 2023, and on July 20, 2023, declared common 
dividends of $0.53 per share for the third quarter of 2023. Citi 
intends to maintain a quarterly common dividend of at least 
$0.53 per share, subject to financial and macroeconomic 
conditions as well as its Board of Directors’ approval.

As discussed above, Citi’s ability to pay common stock 
dividends is subject to limitations on capital distributions in 
the event of a breach of any regulatory capital buffers, 
including the Stress Capital Buffer, with the degree of such 
restrictions based on the extent to which the buffers are 
breached. For additional information, see “Capital Resources
—Regulatory Capital Buffers” and “Risk Factors—Strategic 
Risks” in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

Any dividend on Citi’s outstanding common stock would 

also need to be in compliance with Citi’s obligations on its 
outstanding preferred stock. 

On July 20, 2023, Citi declared preferred dividends of 

approximately $333 million for the third quarter of 2023. 

For information on the ability of Citigroup’s subsidiary 
depository institutions to pay dividends, see Note 19 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2022 Form 10-K.

OTHER INFORMATION
During the second quarter of 2023, no director or executive 
officer of Citi adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 or non-
Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each, as defined in Item 408 
of Regulation S-K).

translation*: Represents GAAP items, excluding the impact 
of FX translation, whereby the prior periods’ foreign currency 
balances are translated into U.S. dollars at the current period’s

RWA: Risk-weighted assets. Basel III establishes two 
comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (the 
Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches), which 
include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk and 
operational risk for Advanced Approaches. Key differences in 
the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized 
and Advanced Approaches are that for Advanced, credit risk 
RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches that largely rely on 
the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for 
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on 
supervisory risk-weightings, which vary primarily by 
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is 
calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III 
Standardized Approach and Basel III Advanced Approaches.

securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements.

SLR: Supplementary Leverage ratio. Represents Tier 1 
Capital divided by total leverage exposure.

SOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate

SPEs: Special purpose entities

Standardized Approach: Established through Basel III, the 
Standardized Approach aligns regulatory capital requirements 
more closely with the key elements of banking risk by 
introducing a wider differentiation of risk weights and a wider 
recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques, while 
avoiding excessive complexity. Accordingly, the Standardized 
Approach produces capital ratios more in line with the actual 
economic risks that banks are facing. 

Structured notes: Financial instruments whose cash flows are 
linked to the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, 
foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates 
or other market variables. The notes typically contain 
embedded (but not separable or detachable) derivatives. 
Contractual cash flows for principal, interest or both can vary 
in amount and timing throughout the life of the note based on 
non-traditional indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional 
interest rates or indexes.

Tangible book value per share (TBVPS)*: Represents 
tangible common equity divided by EOP common shares 
outstanding.

Taxable equivalent basis: Represents the total revenue, net of 
interest expense for the business, adjusted for revenue from 
investments that receive tax credits and the impact of tax-
exempt securities. This metric presents results on a level 
comparable to taxable investments and securities. GAAP 
measures on taxable equivalent basis, including the metrics 
derived from these measures, are non-GAAP financial 
measures.

TDR: Troubled debt restructuring. Prior to January 1, 2023, a 
TDR was deemed to occur when the Company modified the 
original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to 
a borrower that was experiencing financial difficulty. Loans 
with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are 
not considered concessions were not TDRs. The accounting 
guidance for TDRs was eliminated with the adoption of ASU 
2022-02. See Note 1 for more information.

Total payout ratio*: Represents total common dividends 
declared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of 
net income available to common shareholders.

Transformation: Citi has embarked on a multiyear 
transformation, with the target outcome to change Citi’s 
business and operating models such that they simultaneously 
strengthen risk and controls and improve Citi’s value to 
customers, clients and shareholders. 

Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have 
not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit 
an independent certified public accountant to express an 
opinion.

U.S. government agencies: U.S. government agencies 
include, but are not limited to, agencies such as Ginnie Mae 
and FHA, and do not include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
which are U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (U.S. 
GSEs). In general, obligations of U.S. government agencies 
are fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of 
principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. 
government in the event of a default.
